******_Restraining_an_Airplane_******
If you wanted to anchor an airplane into the ground so it wouldn't be able to
take off, what would the rope have to be made out of?
---Connor Childerhose
Ah, the Just_Cause_2_scenario.
At takeoff, a 747's four engines can each generate 281.57 kN of thrust. I have
no real sense for what that number means, so let's put it in different terms:

A 747 with all engines at full could roughly balance the weight of a dangling
blue whale.
With all that weight, how thick would the cable need to be?
Surprisingly, not all that thick! A cable a little over an inch in diameter
would do it.[1]Bethlehem Wire Rope General_Purpose_Catalog
Let's suppose you don't have a cable lying around. What else could you use?
If you're into fishing, you might have some fishing line. A typical line for
saltwater fishing might have a 50-100 lb strength,[2]West Marine: Selecting
Fishing_Line so it would take a brigade of several thousand people armed with
fishing rods to restrain the plane.

If you don't have fishing line, there's one thing you probably do have: Hair.
While hair isn't as strong as steel, it's just about the strongest material in
your body,[3]Examples_of_the_Tensile_Strength_of_Materials with a tensile
strength rivaling or exceeding that of bone.[4]Properties_of_Textile_Fibers
This tensile strength is why performers are able to hang by their hair at the
circus. In fact, from a materials standpoint, it's actually more impressive
that performers are able to hang by their arms.
Based on these hair strength figures, a piece of hair three inches in diameter
would be strong enough to restrain a 747.[5]If you wanted to measure the
strength of a strand of hair, you could use the device described by US_Patent
#4628742A, &quot;Tensile strength tester for hair&quot;
Hairs that big around are hard to come by.[6]... I hope. Since most of us have
many small hairs, instead of one big hair ...

... we'd need to get a lot of hairs and bundle them together. Given that
individual hairs can support about 50 grams of weight, we'd need roughly 20
heads of hair to restrain the aircraft.

Conclusion: Restraining a plane with a cable would be pretty easy.
Further conclusion: Blue whales are not typically covered in hair,[8]Although
they are mammals, most whales do_not_have_coats_of_hair_like_land_mammals
typically_do but if we transplanted the hair from at least 20 human heads onto
a blue whale ...

... it would have enough hair to perform acrobatics at a circus.
