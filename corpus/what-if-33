How much would the sea level fall if every ship were removed all at once from
the Earth's waters?
---Michael Toje
About six microns---slightly more than the diameter of a strand of spider silk.

Archimedes' principle tells us that the water displaced by a ship weighs as
much as the ship itself. If we can figure out the total weight of all the
world's ships, we can figure out how much water they're displacing, then
divide that volume by the surface area of the ocean to figure out how much the
water level would drop.
Weighing_ships_is_confusing. There are a bunch of different measurements of the
size of a ship, and many of them, like gross tonnage, are actually measures of
the volume of the ship's rooms and other internal spaces, not its weight.
The UN Conference on Trade and Development publishes_estimatesÂ of the size of
the world shipping fleet.
What the UNCTD publishes is "deadweight tonnage", which is the maximum
weight of the ship's fuel, cargo, and crew. What we wantÂ is
"displacement". Unfortunately, comprehensive numbers for displacement are
harder to find.
Fortunately, we can estimate it. Brian Barrass's book Ship Design and
Performance for Masters and MatesÂ gives a table of ratios of deadweight
tonnage to displacement for different types of ships.
Extrapolating from the last few years of UNCTD data, and using the coefficients
from the book, suggests that the world fleet weighs about 2.15 billion tons
when fully loaded. The main component of the fleet by weight is oil tankers and
bulk ore-carrying ships, which make up over two-thirds of the total. (The UNCTD
data doesn't include small recreational boats or naval fleets. However, based
on some numbers for naval_fleetsÂ and recreational_boats, neither one
contributes much to the total.)
A ton of water is about a cubic meter. 2.15 billion cubic meters divided by the
surface area of the oceans equals about 6 microns (0.006 mm).
But you don't have to worry about that six-micron sea level drop. The oceans
are currently rising at about 3.3 millimeters per year due to global warming
(through both glacial melting and thermal expansion of seawater).
At that rate (normalized for seasonal variation and short-term fluctations), if
you removed every ship from the ocean, the water would be back up to its
original average level in 16 hours.

Sea levels will likely rise a few feet by the year 2100. Current fish wet
biomass is about 2_billion_tons, so removing them won't make a dent either.
(Marine fish biomass dropped_by_80%_over_the_last_century, which---taking into
consideration the growth rate of the world's shipping fleet---leads to an odd
conclusion: Sometime in the last few years, we reached a point where there are,
by weight, more ships in the ocean than fish.)
And what about the old joke about how much deeper the ocean would be without
sponges? While estimates of sponge biomass are hard to come by, the answer is
probably that if you removed all the sponges, sea level would drop by no more
than a few microns ... and much less if you squeezed them out first.
