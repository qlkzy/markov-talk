What place on Earth would allow you to freefall the longest by jumping off it?
What about using a squirrel suit?
---Dhash Shrivathsa
The largest purely vertical drop on Earth is the face of Canada's Mount_Thor,
which is shaped like this:

To make things a little less gruesome, let's suppose there's a pit at the
bottom of the cliff, filled with something fluffy---like cotton candy---to
safely break your fall.

A human falling with arms and legs outstretched has a terminal velocity in the
neighborhood of 55 meters per second. It takes a few hundred meters to get up
to speed, so it would take you a little over 26 seconds to fall the full
distance.
What can you do in 26 seconds?
For starters, it's enough time to get all the way through the original Super
Mario World 1-1,[1]Super_Mario_1-1_speed_run assuming you have perfect timing
and take the shortcut through the pipe.
It's also long enough to miss a phone call. Sprint's ring cycle---the time the
phone rings before going to voicemail---is 23 seconds.[2]Sprint_ring_cycle (For
those keeping score, that means Wagner's is 2,350 times longer.)
If someone called your phone, and it started ringing the moment you jumped, it
would go to voicemail three seconds before you reached the bottom.

On the other hand, if you jumped off Ireland's 210-meter Cliffs_of_Moher, you
would only be able to fall for about eight seconds---or a little more, if the
updrafts were strong. That's not very long, but according to River Tam, given
adequate vacuuming systems it might be enough time to drain all the blood from
your body.
So far, we've assumed you're falling vertically. But you don't have to.
Even without any special equipment, a skilled skydiver---once they get up to
full speed---can glide at almost a 45-degree angle.[3]Glide_data By gliding
away from the base of the cliff, you could conceivably extend your fall
substantially.

It's hard to say exactly how far; in addition to the local terrain, it depends
heavily on your choice of clothes. As a comment on a BASE_jumping_records_wiki
puts it,
     The record for longest [fall time] without a wingsuit is hard to find
     since the line between jeans and wingsuits has blurred since the
     introduction of more advanced ... apparel.
Which brings us to wingsuits---the halfway point between parachute pants and
parachutes.
Wingsuits let you fall much more slowly. One wingsuit operator posted tracking
data from a series of jumps.[4]Jump._Fly._Land., Air &amp; Space It shows that
in a glide, a wingsuit can lose altitude as slowly as 18 meters per second---a
huge improvement over the normal rate.
Even ignoring horizontal travel, that would stretch out our fall to over a
minute. That's long_enough_for_a_chess_game. It's also long enough to sing the
first verse of---appropriately enough---REM's It's the End of the World as We
Know It followed by---less appropriately---the entire breakdown from the end of
the Spice Girls' Wannabe.

When we include horizontal glides, the times get even longer.
There are a lot of mountains that could probably support very long wingsuit
flights. For example, Nanga Parbat, a mountain in Pakistan, has a drop of more
than three kilometers at a fairly steep angle.[5]Prof. Dr. Herrligkoffer, The
East_Pillar_of_Nanga_Parbat, The Alpine Journal (1984) (Surprisingly, a
wingsuit still works fine at those altitudes,[6]The_Guestroom_-_Dr_Glenn
Singleman_and_Heather_Swan [7]Highest_BASE_jump:_Valery_Rozov_breaks_Guinness
world_record though the jumper needs oxygen and glides a little faster than
normal.)
So far, the record for longest wingsuit BASE jump is held by Dean Potter, who
jumped from the Eiger---a mountain in Switzerland---and flew for three minutes
and twenty seconds.[8]Dean Potter, Above_It_All
What could you do with three minutes and twenty seconds?
Suppose we recruit Joey Chestnut and Takeru Kobayashi, the world's top
competitive eaters.
If we can find a way for them to operate wingsuits while eating at full speed,
and they jumped from the Eiger, they could---in theory---finish as many as 45
hot dogs between them before reaching the ground ... pass

... which would, if nothing else, earn them what just might be the strangest
world record in history.
