How long would it take for people to notice their weight gain if the mean
radius of the world expanded by 1cm every second? (Assuming the average
composition of rock were maintained.)

The Earth is not, currently, expanding.[1]Yes, I have a citation for this.

&quot;In conclusion, no statistically significant present expansion rate is
detected by our study within the current measurement uncertainty of 0.2 mm
yrâ1.&quot;

People have long suggested that it might be. Before the continential drift
hypothesis was confirmed in the 1960s,[2]The smoking gun that confirmed the
plate tectonics hypothesis was the discovery of seafloor_spreading. The way
seafloor spreading and magnetic_pole_reversal neatly confirmed each other is
one of my favorite examples of scientific discovery at work. people had noticed
that the continents fit together. Various ideas were put forward to explain
this, including the idea that the ocean basins were rifts that opened in the
surface of a previously-smooth Earth as it expanded. This theory was never very
widespread,[3]It turns out it's kind of dumb. although it still periodically
makes the rounds on YouTube.
To avoid the problem of rifts in the ground, let's imagine all the matter in
the Earth, from the crust to the core, starts expanding uniformly. To avoid
another Drain_the_Oceans scenario, we'll assume the ocean expands, too.[4]As it
turns out, the ocean is expanding, since it's getting warmer. This is
(currently) the main way global warming is raising the sea level. All human
structures will stay.

As the Earth started expanding, you'd feel a slight jolt, and might even lose
your balance for a moment. This would be very brief. Since you're moving
steadily upward at 1 cm/s, you woudn't feel any kind of ongoing acceleration.
For the rest of the day, you wouldn't notice much of anything.
t = 1 day:
After the first day, the Earth would have expanded by 864 meters.
[/imgs/a/67/expanding_day.png]
Gravity would take a long time to increase. If you weighed 70 kilograms when
the expansion started, you'd weigh 70.01 at the end of the day.
What about our roads and bridges? Eventually, they would have to break up,
right?
Not as quickly as you might think. Here's a puzzle I once heard:
     Imagine you tied a rope tightly around the Earth, so it was hugging
     the surface all the way around.
[/imgs/a/67/expanding_rope.png]
     Now imagine you wanted to raise the rope one meter off the ground.
[/imgs/a/67/expanding_lift.png]
     How much extra length will you need to add to the rope?
Though it may seem like you'd need miles of rope, the answer is 6.28 meters.
Circumference is proportional to radius, so if you increase radius by 1 unit,
you increase circumference by 2π units.
Stretching a 40,000-kilometer line an extra 6.28 meters is pretty negligible.
Even after a day, the extra 5.4 kilometers would be handled easily by virtually
all structures. Concrete expands and contracts by more than that every day.

After the initial jolt, one of the first effects you'd notice would be that
your GPS would stop working. The satellites would stay in roughly the same
orbits, but the delicate timing that the GPS system is based on would be
completely ruined within hours. GPS timing is incredibly precise; of all the
problems in engineering, it's one of the only ones in which engineers have been
forced to include both special and general relativity in their calculations.
Most other clocks would keep working fine. However, if you have a very precise
pendulum clock, you might notice something odd---by the end of the day, it
would be three seconds ahead of where it should be.
t = 1 month:
After a month, the Earth would have expanded by 26 kilometers---an increase of
0.4%---and its mass would have increased by 1.2%. Surface gravity would only
have gone up by 0.4%, rather than 1.2%, since surface gravity is proportional
to radius.[6]Mass is proportional to radius cubed, and gravity is proportional
to mass times inverse square of radius, so radius3 / radius2 = radius.
You might notice the difference in weight on a scale, but it's not a big deal.
Gravity varies by this much between different cities already. This is a good
thing to keep in mind if you buy a digital scale. If your scale has a precision
of more than two decimal places, you need to calibrate it with a test
weight---the force of gravity at the scale factory isn't necessarily the same
as the force of gravity at your house.
While you might not notice the increased gravity just yet, you'd notice the
expansion. After a month, you'd see a lot of cracks opening up in long concrete
structures and the failure of elevated roads and old bridges. Most buildings
would probably be ok, although those anchored firmly into bedrock might start
to behave unpredictably.[7]Just what you want in a skyscraper.
At this point, astronauts on the ISS would start getting worried. Not only
would the ground (and atmosphere) be rising toward them, but the increased
gravity would also cause their orbit to slowly shrink. They'd need to evacuate
quickly; they'd have at most a few months before the station reentered the
atmosphere and deorbited.
t = 1 year:
After a year, gravity would be 5% stronger. You'd probably notice the weight
gain, and you'd definitely notice the failure of roads, bridges, power lines,
satellites, and undersea cables. Your pendulum clock would now be ahead by five
days.
What about the atmosphere?
If the atmosphere isn't growing like the land and water are, air pressure would
start dropping. This is due to a combination of factors. As gravity increases,
then air gets heavier. But since that air is spread out over a larger area, the
overall effect would be decreasing air pressure.
On the other hand, if the atmosphere is also expanding, surface air pressure
would rise. After years had passed, the top of Mt. Everest would no longer be
in the &quot;death zone&quot;.[8]See What-If_#64. On the other hand, since
you'd be heavier---and the mountain would be taller---climbing would be more
work.
t = 5 years:
After five years, gravity would be 25% stronger. If you weighed 70 kg when the
expansion started, you'd weigh 88 kg now.
Most of our infrastructure would have collapsed. The cause of the collapse
would be the expanding ground below them, not the increased gravity.
Surprisingly, most skyscrapers would hold up fine under much higher gravity.
[9]Although I wouldn't trust the elevators. For most of them, the limiting
factor isn't weight, but wind.
t = 10 years:
After 10 years, gravity would be 50% stronger. In the scenario where the
atmosphere isn't expanding, the air would become thin enough to be difficult to
breathe even at sea level. In the other scenario, we'd be ok for a little while
longer.
t = 40 years:
After 40 years, Earth's surface gravity would have tripled.[10]Over decades,
the force of gravity would grow slightly faster than you'd expect, since the
material in the Earth would compress under its own weight. The pressure inside
planets is roughly_proportional_to_the_square_of_their_surface_area, so the
Earth's core would be squeezed tightly. At this point, even the strongest
humans would only be able to walk with great difficulty. Breathing would be
difficult. Trees would collapse. Crops wouldn't stand up under their own
weight. Virtually every mountainside would see massive landslides as material
sought out a shallower angle_of_repose.
Geologic activity would also accelerate. Most of the Earth's heat is provided
by radioactive decay of minerals in the crust and mantle,[12]Although some
radioactive elements, like uranium, are heavy, they get squeezed out of the
lower layers because their atoms don't mesh well with the rock lattices at
those depths. For more, see this_chapter and this_article. and more Earth means
more heat. Since the volume expands faster than the surface area, the overall
heat flowing out per square meter will increase.
It's not actually enough to substantially warm the planet---Earth's surface
temperature is dominated by the atmosphere and the Sun---but it would lead to
more volcanoes, more earthquakes, and faster tectonic movement. This would be
similar to the situation on Earth billions of years ago, when we had more
radioactive material and thus a hotter mantle.
More active plate tectonics might be good for life. Plate tectonics play a key
role in stabilizing the Earth's climate, and planets smaller than Earth (like
Mars) don't have enough internal heat to sustain long-term geologic activity. A
larger planet would allow for more geologic activity, which is why some
scientists think that exoplanets slightly larger than Earth (&quot;super-
Earths&quot;) could be more friendly to life than Earth-sized ones.

t = 100 years:
After 100 years, we'd be experiencing over six gees of gravity. Not only would
we be unable to move around to find food, but our hearts would be unable to
pump blood to our brains. Only small insects (and sea animals) would be
physically able to move around. Perhaps humans could survive in specially-built
controlled-pressure domes, moving around by keeping most of our bodies
submerged in water.
[/imgs/a/67/expanding_water.png]
Breathing in this situation would be difficult. It's hard to suck in air
against the weight of the water, which is why snorkels can only work when your
lungs are near the surface.
Outside of low-pressure domes, the air would become unbreathable for a
different reason. At somewhere around 6 atmospheres, even ordinary air becomes
toxic.[13]R.M. Franz and P.C. Schutte, Barometric_hazards_within_the_context_of
deep-level_mining, The Journal of The South African Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy Even if we'd managed to survive all the other problems, by 100
years, we'd be dead from oxygen_toxicity. Toxicity aside, breathing dense air
is difficult simply because it's heavy.
Black hole?
When would the Earth eventually become a black hole?
It's hard to answer that, because the premise of the question is that the
radius is steadily expanding while the density stays the same---whereas a black
hole, the density increases.
The dynamics of really huge rocky planets aren't often analyzed, since there's
no obvious way that they could form; anything that large will have enough
gravity to gather hydrogen and helium during planet formation and become a gas
giant.
At some point, our growing Earth would reach the point where adding more mass
causes it to contract, rather than expand. After this point, it would collapse
into something like a sputtering white dwarf or neutron star, and then---if its
mass kept increasing---eventually become a black hole.
But before it gets that far ...
t = 300 years:
It's a shame humans wouldn't live this long, because at this point, something
really neat would happen.
As the Earth grows, the Moon would, like all our satellites, gradually spiral
inward.[14]Plummer, H. C., Note_on_the_motion_about_an_attracting_centre_of
slowly_increasing_mass, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol.
66, p.83 After several centuries, it would be close enough to the swollen Earth
that the tidal forces between Earth and the Moon would be stronger than the
gravitational forces holding the Moon together.
When the Moon passed this boundary---called the Roche_limit---it would
gradually break apart ...

... and Earth would, for a short time, have rings.
