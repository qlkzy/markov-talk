How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?

Surprisingly fast.

First, a disclaimer: After reading this article, don't try to drive over speed
bumps at high speeds. Here are some reasons:
â¢ You could hit and kill someone.
â¢ It can destroy your tires, suspension, and potentially your entire car.
â¢ Have you read any of the other articles on this blog?
If that's not enough, here are some quotes from medical journals on spinal
injury from speed bumps:
     Examination of the thoracolumbar X-ray and computed tomography
     displayed compression fractures in four patients ... Posterior
     instrumentation was applied ... All patients recovered well except
     for the one with cervical fracture.[1]Speed_bumpâinduced_spinal
     column_injury
     L1 was the most frequently fractured vertebra (23/52, 44.2%)[2]Speed
     hump_spine_fractures:_injury_mechanism_and_case_series
     Incorporation of the buttocks with realistic properties diminished
     the first vertical natural frequency from ~12 to 5.5 Hz, in agreement
     with the literature.[3]Source: The_2nd_American_Conference_on_Human
     Vibration.
(That last one isn't directly related to speed bump injuries, but I wanted to
include it anyway.)
Regular little speed bumps probably won't kill you
Speed bumps are designed to make drivers to slow down. Going over a typical
speed bump at 5 miles per hour[4]Like anyone with a physics background, I do
all my calculations in SI units, but I've gotten too many US speeding tickets
to write this article in anything but miles per hour; it's just been burned
into my brain. Sorry! results in a gentle bounce, while hitting one at 20
delivers a sizable jolt. It's natural to assume that hitting a speed bump at 60
would deliver a proportionally larger jolt, but it probably wouldn't.
As those quotes attest, it's true that people are occasionally injured by speed
bumps. However, nearly all of those injuries happen to a very specific category
of people: Those sitting in hard seats in the backs of buses, riding on poorly-
maintained roads.
When you're driving a car, the two main things protecting you from bumps in the
road are the tires and the suspension. No matter how fast you hit a speed bump,
unless the bump is particularly large, enough of the jolt will be absorbed by
these two systems that you probably won't be hurt.
Absorbing the shock won't necessarily be good for those systems. In the case of
the tires, they may absorb it by exploding.[5]Citation: Just Google &quot;hit_a
curb_at_60&quot;. If the bump is large enough, it may permanently damage a lot
of important parts of the car.
The typical speed bump is between three and four inches tall. That's also about
how thick an average tire's cushion is (the separation between the bottom of
the rims and the ground).[6]Citation: There are cars everywhere. Go outside
with a ruler and check. This means that if a car hits a small speed bump, the
rim won't actually touch the bump; the tire will just be compressed.
The typical sedan has a top speed of around 120 miles per hour. Hitting a speed
bump at that speed would, in one way or another, probably result in losing
control of the car and crashing.[7]At high speeds, you can easily lose control
even without hitting a bump. Joey Huneycutt's 220 mph crash left his Camaro a
burned-out_hulk. However, the jolt itself probably wouldn't be fatal.
If you hit a larger speed bump---like a speed_hump or speed_table---your car
might not fare so well.[8]Youtube:_Speed_bump_in_Dubai_+_flying_Gallardo
How fast would you have to go to definitely die?
Let's consider what would happen if a car went were going faster than its top
speed.
The average modern car is limited to a top speed of around 120 mph, and the
fastest can go about 200.[9]The Bentley_Continental_Flying_Spur has a top speed
of 199.64 miles per hour.
While most passenger cars have some kind of artificial speed limits imposed by
the engine computer, the ultimate physical limit to a car's top speed comes
from air resistance. This type of drag increases up with the square of speed;
at some point, a car doesn't have enough engine power to push through the air
any faster.
If you did force a sedan to go faster than its top speed---perhaps by re-using
the magical accelerator from the relativistic_baseball---the speed bump would
be the least of your problems.
Cars generate lift. The air flowing around a car exerts all kinds of forces on
it.

The lift forces are relatively minor at normal highway speeds, but at higher
speeds they become substantial.
In a Formula One car equipped with airfoils, this force pushes downward,
holding the car against the track. In a sedan, they lift it up.[10]Parker,
Barry R.. &quot;Aerodynamic Design.&quot; In The Isaac Newton school of
driving: physics and your car. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press,
2003. 155.
Among NASCAR fans, there's frequently talk of a 200-mph &quot;liftoff
speed&quot; if the car starts to spin.[11]The_Myth_of_the_200-mph_&quot;Lift-
Off_Speed&quot; Other branches of auto racing have seen spectacular[12]Youtube:
Porsche_911_GT2_(or_GT1)_crash backflip crashes[13]Youtube:_Mercedes_CLR-GTR_Le
Mans_Flip when the aerodynamics don't work out as planned.
The bottom line is that at somewhere in the range of 150-300 mph, a typical
sedan will lift off the ground, tumble, and crash ... before you even hit the
speed bump.

If you kept the car from taking off, the force of the wind at those speeds
would strip away the the hood, side panels, and windows. At higher speeds, the
car itself would be disassembled, or even burn up like a spacecraft reentering
the atmosphere.
What's the ultimate limit?
In the state of Pennsylvania, drivers may have $2 added to their speeding
ticket for every mile per hour by which they break the speed limit.[14]NHTSA,
Summary_of_State_Speed_Laws, 2007
Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90% of the
speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ...

... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.
