Am I right to be afraid of pressure cookers? What's the worst thing that can
happen if you misuse a pressure cooker in an ordinary kitchen?

The worstÂ thing?

Pressure cookers are dangerous.
They can explode, in a sense, but not as violently as you might fear (or hope).
The pressure inside a consumer cooker doesn't go above about two
atmospheres---about the pressure inside_a_can_of_soda. Those levels can be
dangerous, but they're generally not high enough to cause the metal to
violently rupture.
So what makes a pressure cooker dangerous?
Imagine a world where Pepsi is scalding hot. Now imagine that someone shakes up
a can of Pepsi and sets it in front of you.

That's the real threat from a pressure cooker: If the seal fails (or the lid
is opened too early), it can spray_scalding_stew_in_all_directions.
But it's not really an explosion.
The blast couldn't even fling the lid very far. If you mounted a rifle-style
barrel on a pressure cooker, even in ideal circumstances it wouldn't be able
to fire the lid much faster than you could throw it. Any potato cannon
(especially this_one) could do better.
Of course, the question wasn't about whether a pressure cooker is likely to
explode. It was about what the worst thing that could happen was.
If you disable the safety valve, there are plenty of ways to produce much more
dangerous pressures. You could completely fill it with water and heat it, fill
it_with_Drano_and_aluminum_foil, or just pump in air from a compressor.
The result would depend on your pressure cooker. Chances are it would start to
leak. If it didn't, and it somehow stayed together up a few hundred
atmospheres (pressures typical of scuba tank), when it finally rupturedÂ it
could easily kill you.

Even so, that's far from the worstÂ thing you could do with a pressure
cooker.
Frankly, there are so many options it would be impossible to survey them all.
But for my money, one of the most horrifying things you could do is this:
(Note: NeverÂ try this, for reasons which will become obvious in a moment.)
Fill the cooker with oxygen up to 5 PSI, then pump in fluorine until it starts
escaping through the safety valve. Put the vessel over an open flame until it
reaches 700Â°C (That's Â°C, not Â°F. Yes, this will probably set off the
smoke alarm.) Now, pump the hot gas over a liquid-oxygen-cooled stainless steel
surface.
The procedure here is a little tricky, but if you do things right, the gas will
condense into dioxygen difluorideÂ (O2F2).
And that stuff is awful.
Ray Bradbury taught_usÂ that paper burns when exposed to oxygen at temperatures
above 451Â°F. Dioxygen difluoride is so volatile that it makes almost any
organic substance ignite and explode at any temperature hotter than 300Â°F
below zero.Â It can literally make iceÂ catch fire.
In_an_article_about_O2F2, Chemistry blogger Derek Lowe (of the excellent In The
Pipeline) used phrases like "violently hideous", "deeply alarming", and
"chemicals that I never hope to encounter". Another_articleÂ refers to
fluorine as "the gas of Lucifer", and lists chemists who were poisoned or
blown up while attempting to work with it.
If your house is heated by natural gas, and it happens to contain hydrogen
sulfide, you could pipe some of it into your container of O2F2. In addition to
a massive explosion, this will alsoÂ produce a cloud of hydrogen fluoride gas.
Hydrogen fluoride can dissolve human tissue on contact, starting with your
lungs and corneas.
As Lowe points out, the chemistry of this kind of reaction (O2F2Â and sulfides)
is largely unexplored.
Which gives us an answer to our question. What's the worst thing that can
happen in a pressure cooker?
