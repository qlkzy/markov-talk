How much cornstarch can I rinse down the drain before unpleasant things start
to happen?

It depends what you consider unpleasant.
If you watered down the cornstarch enough, you could likely pour it down the
drain for years without any ill effects. If it didn't clog the sink, the rest
of the pipes could probably handle it. It might provoke some confusion among
the sewage treatment people, but it wouldn't break anything.
But it'd be terrifically boring (and thus unpleasant) to pour cornstarch down
a sink all day, so I guess that's---

... Oh. Huh.
Well, let's thicken the cornstarch.
When you mix cornstarch and water in a bit under a 2:1 ratio, you get oobleck,
a substance with some odd physical properties. This is a great kitchen science
experiment everyone should try at least once.
At low speeds, oobleck behaves like a liquid. If you gently swish your fingers
in a bowl of it, it feels like milk or heavy cream. However, if you make a fist
and punch the surface, your hand bounces off with a thud---it's like hitting
a slab of raw meat.
If you vibrate oobleck, even stranger_things_happen.
It wouldn't take much of the mixture to clog a drain. It depends on your
plumbing, but you could probably stop up your sink with a small bowl of it.
Since your drain is clogged, I guess that's the answer to your question.

Well, ok. I guess some people don't mind clogged drains.
If you keep at it, after a few minutes, your sink will overflow, spilling goop
onto your floor.

Financially, this will be hard to keep up. If you're mixing as fast as the
water will come out of the sink, this project may cost you in the neighborhood
of $5,000 per day if you can't find a good bulk distributor.

At this rate, it should build up on the floor at a rate of an inch or two per
day.

If your doors are sealed well, it will continue to build up. Once it reaches
knee height (a week or two after you started), you may be able to hold the
rising tide at bay for a little bit---at least in one room---by getting someone
to flush the toilet repeatedly. The pipes there are larger and harder to clog;
the limiting factor would probably be how fast the tank filled with water.

Eventually, after a month or two, the oobleck would reach the living room
window. The pressure would quickly rise, and sooner or later the window would
burst.
As the deadly Boston_Molasses_Flood proved, even thick, viscous fluids can flow
quickly when in large enough quantities. The oobleck would pour rapidly out
onto the lawn, carrying you with it.
At this point, the local officials would probably notice and, at the very
least, shut off your water.

But I guess if you really like cornstarch that much, nothing unpleasant has
happened.
