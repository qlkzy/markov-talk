What if you somehow managed to make a stereo travel at twice the speed of
sound, would it sound backwards to someone who was just casually sitting
somewhere as it flies by?
---Tim Currie
Yes.
Technically, anyway. It would be pretty hard to hear.
The basic idea is pretty straightforward. The stereo is going faster than its
own sound, so it will reach you first, followed by the sound it emitted one
second ago, followed by the sound it emitted two seconds ago, and so forth.

The problem is that the stereo is moving at Mach 2, which means that two
seconds ago, it was over a kilometer away. It's hard to hear music from that
distance, particularly when your ears were just hit by (a) a sonic boom, and
(b) pieces of a rapidly disintegrating stereo.
Wind speeds of Mach 2 would messily disassemble most consumer electronics. The
force of the wind on the body of the stereo is roughly comparable to that of a
dozen people standing on it:

An ordinary stereo wouldn't make it, but one with some kind of ruggedized
high-strength casing might be able to survive.
If we put together a durable, heavy-duty stereo and launch it on a ballistic
trajectory, it will only be traveling at supersonic speeds for the first 150
meters or so. This means that the target will hear a maximum of about a third
of a second of reversed music.
This phenomenon is actually confirmed in the 2008 paper Reproduction_of_Virtual
Sound_Sources_Moving_at_Supersonic_Speeds_in_Wave_Field_Synthesis, which says
that the sound wave field "contains a component carrying a time-reversed
version of the source's input signal".
The sonic boom would be the first thing the target would hear. It would be
followed by several sounds played over one another, including both reversed
music (rising slightly in pitch as it fades out) and forward-playing music
(which would play at half speed and an octave too low), followed by the crash
of a stereo demolishing your neighbor's shed.
Which means that if you're playing one of those albums containing secret
demonic messages, the result will be the strangest listening experience of your
life:
