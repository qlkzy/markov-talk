If winds reached 500 mph, would it pick up a human?
Grey Flynn, age 7, Stoneham, MA
Absolutely!

Some things don't work like they do in the movies. Getting shot doesn't really
make someone fly backward. The vacuum of space doesn't make your skin explode.
But high wind can definitely pick up a person. In fact, if you were standing in
the parking lot, the wind wouldn't just pick you up---it would also peel the
pavement from the ground!

It wouldn't be strong enough to peel your skin off. Humans can survive blasts
of 500 mph wind, which is important because pilots sometimes need to eject from
airplanes at those speeds.
In the 1940s, the US government put pilots in wind tunnels to learn how they
reacted to high winds. Have you ever been curious what happens to a person's
face in 457 mph winds? Well, you can watch a video of one of those wind tunnel
tests here. (That test was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center, where I
worked before I started drawing internet comics for a living.)
It doesn't look very comfortable---I didn't know cheeks could flap like
that---but the pilot appears to stay alive.
Luckily, he's strapped into that chair. He wouldn't be able to stand up in
those winds! If he tried, he would go flying backward down the tunnel.
High wind is really powerful. In a paper in the journal Weather, J. F. R.
McIlveen showed how to calculate the force of wind on the human body.

Weather 57, no. 11 (2002): 410-413. The calculations on page 2 show how far
you'd have to lean to stay upright in wind of various speeds.

When wind speed rises above about 120 mph, it's no longer possible to stay
upright no matter how far you lean; you'll start to slide backward across the
ground,[2]When Hurricane Isabel hit Virginia in 2003, I had the bright idea of
standing on a skateboard with a poncho held up like a sail, so the wind would
blow me down the street. But the moment I got the sail up, the wind fell quiet.

Later, I learned that people die_from_doing_that. Oops. then quickly go head
over heels and start to tumble.
You wouldn't necessarily be thrown very high. If the wind were perfectly level,
you'd tumble along the surface, bouncing against the ground. However, if there
were any updrafts, you could easily be lifted up and carried away.
The good news is that 500 mph winds are rare. The strongest hurricanes have
wind speeds around 200 mph with gusts up to 250.[3]Courtney, J.; Buchan, S.;
Cerveny, R.S.; Bessemoulin, P.; Peterson, T.C.; Rubiera Torres, J.M.; Beven,
J.; King, J.; Trerwin, B.; Rancourt, K.. 2012 &quot;Documentation_and

Island,_Australia,_during_passage_of_tropical_cyclone_Olivia.&quot; Australian
Meterological and Oceanographic Journal, 62 (1). 1-9. Tornadoes can reach 300
mph.[4]It's difficult to get accurate measurements of surface winds since those
tornadoes destroy_most_measuring_equipment! 300 is a far cry from 500; the
force from a 500 mph wind is several times stronger than the force from a 300
mph wind.
There are a few ways you could experience wind speeds faster than 500 mph. One
is to stand on top of a volcano when it erupts.Â When Mount St. Helens exploded
in 1980, the column of ash was blasted outward at 700 mph, which is close to
the speed of sound.[5]Kieffer, S. W., 1981, Fluid dynamics of the May 18 blast
at Mount St. Helens, in Lipman, P.W., and Mullineux, D.R., eds., The 1980
Eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington: U.S. Geological Survey Professional
Paper 1250, p. 379-400.
Another way to experience 500 mph winds is to trigger a hypercane.[6]Limits_on
Hurricane_Intensity A hypercane is an exotic type of hurricane with 500 mph
winds spinning in a very tight vortex just a few miles across.
Hypercanes can't exist on Earth right now. To form, they require ocean
temperatures of about 50Â°C. No matter how much we warm the planet, we're not
going to get the temperature that high any time soon.
However, there's one way these storms might happen.
When an asteroid or comet---coincidentally, one about the size of the recently-
named 4942_Munroe---hit Mexico 65 million years ago, it punched a hole in the
crust and left behind a sea of lava.[7]Christeson, Gail L., Gareth S. Collins,
Joanna V. Morgan, Sean P.S. Gulick, Penny J. Barton, and Michael R. Warner.
&quot;Mantle_Deformation_Beneath_The_Chicxulub_Impact_Crater.&quot; Earth and
Planetary Science Letters 284, no. 1-2 (2009): 249-257. When water flowed back
in to fill the hole, it would have been heated by contact with the molten rock.
This might have created the conditions for hypercanes to form, and one paper
suggests that these storms could have lifted a large amount of dust and debris
into the upper atmosphere---thus contributing to a global winter and extinction
of the dinosaurs.[8]Emanuel, Kerry A., Kevin Speer, Richard Rotunno, Ramesh
Srivastava, and Mario Molina. &quot;Hypercanes:_A_Possible_Link_In_Global
Extinction_Scenarios.&quot; Journal of Geophysical Research 100, no. D7 (1995):
13755-13765.

In short, the answer to Grey's question is yes---500 mph winds would send you
flying through the air. But don't worry about that. Instead, worry about is the
thing that created the 500 mph winds. Odds are, that's what's going to kill
you.
