******_Updating_a_Printed_Wikipedia_******
If you had a printed version of the whole of (say, the English) Wikipedia, how
many printers would you need in order to keep up with the changes made to the
live version?

That's surprisingly few printers! But before you try to create a live-updating
paper Wikipedia, let's look at what those printers would be doing ... and how
much they'd cost.
Printing Wikipedia
People have considered printing out Wikipedia before. A few years ago, student
Rob Matthews printed every_Wikipedia_featured_article, creating a book several
feet thick.
Of course, that's just a small slice of the best of Wikipedia; the entire
encyclopedia would be a lot bigger. Wikipedia user Tompw has set up a_page for
calculating the size of the whole English Wikipedia in printed volumes. It
would currently fill a lot of bookshelves.
Keeping up with the edits would be harder.
Keeping up
The English Wikipedia currently receives about 125,000 to 150,000 edits each
day, or 90-100 per minute.[1]ToolServer:_Edit_rate
We could try to define a way to measure the &quot;word count&quot; of the
average edit, but that's hard bordering on impossible. Fortunately, we don't
need to---we can just estimate that each change is going to require us to
reprint a page somewhere. Many edits will actually change multiple pages---but
many other edits are reverts, which would let us put back pages we've already
printed.[2]The filing system for this would be staggering. One page per edit
seems like a reasonable middle ground.
For a mix of photos, tables, and text typical of Wikipedia, a good inkjet
printer might put out 15 pages per minute. That means you'd only need about six
printers running at any given time to keep pace with the edits.
The paper would stack up quickly. Using Rob Matthews' book as a starting point,
I did my own back-of-the-envelope estimate for the size of the current English
Wikipedia. Based on the average length of featured articles vs. all articles, I
came up with an estimate of 300 cubic meters for a printout of the whole thing.
[3]That's a little larger than Tompw's estimate, but I'm assuming they're
printed straight from the browser, which is less compact and includes images.
By comparison, if you were trying to keep up with the edits, you'd print out
300 cubic meters every month.
$500,000 per month
Six printers isn't that many, but they'd be running all the time. And that gets
expensive.
The electricity to run them would be cheap---a few dollars a day.
The paper would be about one cent per sheet, which means you'll be spending
about a thousand dollars a day.
You'd want to hire people to manage the printers 24/7, but that would actually
cost less than the paper.
Even the printers themselves wouldn't be too expensive, despite the terrifying
replacement cycle.
But the ink cartridges would be a nightmare.
Ink
A study by QualityLogic[4]QualityLogic: Cost_of_Ink_Per_Page_Analysis, June
2012 found that for a typical inkjet printer, the real-life cost of ink ran
from 5 cents per page for black-and-white to around 30 cents per page for
photos. That means you'd be spending four to five figures per day on ink
cartridges.
You definitely want to invest in a laser printer. Otherwise, in just a month or
two, this project could end up costing you half a million dollars:

But that's not even the worst part.
If, someday, Wikipedia decides to go_dark again, and you want to join the
protest ...

You'll have to get a crate of markers and color every page solid black
yourself.
I would definitely stick to digital.
