If cows could photosynthesize, how much less food would they need?
---Anonymous
In a way, they already do. A field of grass sits there all day soaking up
energy from the sun and storing it chemically. A grazing animal can then come
along and absorb weeks of accumulated energy in a matter of minutes.

A Jersey cow presents in the neighborhood of nearly two square meters of usable
space to the sun if it stands right. (Cows would have to be trained to stand
optimally, but we might not have too far to go; research suggests they_already
align_themselves_north-south.
Chlorophyll photosynthesis extracts 3%-6% of the total energy from sunlight. If
we figure on any given day the cow gets the equivalent of about six hours of
peak sunlight, it works out to less than two million joules of usable energy
each day.

Is that a lot? Well, a 450-kilogram cow just wandering around in a field might
eat about 10 kilograms of dry matter a day, extracting on the order of 50
million joules of metabolic energy. So photosynthesis could only make up about
4% of the required intake---saving only a few handfuls of grain.
If we could equip cows with solar panels, which can be several times more
energy-efficient than photosynthesis, we could improve that number---but not by
much.

The basic problem facing cows is the same one facing solar cars---they're too
small. If you saw the world's cattle population in silhouette, they'd have an
overall cross-sectional area of about two thousand square kilometers. This
means that if they were migrating through the air over Rhode Island (biology is
not my strong suit), they'd blot out the sun over barely half the state. They'd
only catch enough sunlight to produce a daily average of about 40 gigawatts of
power (two megayodas).
By contrast, about 3% of the world's surface area is cultivated, which means
that (given rough estimates of geographic distribution of farmland) our crops
easily intercept over a thousand times more sunlight than our cattle---which is
why grazing is a good strategy.
I'd like to conclude with this quote, which I found in the Cedara Agricultural
Development Institute's Applied Ruminant Nutrition for Dairy Cows:
     Cows on a typical dairy ration can produce 80 to 100 litres of saliva
     per day.
This has nothing to do with photosynthesis, but I wanted to share anyway.
