If you could teleport to a random place of the surface of the Earth, what are
the odds that you'll see signs of intelligent life?
Borislav Stanimirov
The surface of the Earth is about 70% water, so you'll usually plop down into
the ocean.

But even there, you could find signs of human habitation.
But first, we'll start with ...
The big stuff
In one way or another, humans have altered every square meter of this planet.
But we'll start with the obvious: Roads, houses, and fields.
To get an idea of how often Borislav would stumble across such obvious
structures, I loaded up a sample of random geographic coordinates[1]Generating
uniform points on a sphere is tricky---you can't just pick a random latitude
and a random longitude. The solution is to either do_a_bunch_of_math or use
something like GeoMidpoint's Random_Point_Generator. in Google Earth.
Most of the points were over open ocean, out of sight of any land. Once you get
away from the major ports, the odds of having a ship in view are not that good,
so I continued sampling until I had 50 land coordinates.
Based on Google Earth imagery, Borislav would definitely see clear signs of
human activity in about 10 of those 50 points. Six of them were actually in
cultivated fields (in Poland, Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan).
Another point was in a highway cut along the coast of French Guiana. One was in
a small town deep in the Amazon, and another on a road in the Australian
outback.
In another five or ten cases, Borislav might be able to see something if you
looked carefully or walked a short distance; it's hard to be sure without
actually visiting the points to find out what you can see. Included in this
list of marginal points was the only US location on the list, a spot in the
woods outside in Keachi, Louisiana---a town which, during the American Civil
War, saw the creation of a contingent of 'Highlanders' complete with
government-issued kilts and plaids.
Most of the points were in the middle of deserts, barren mountains, tropical
jungles. or---in one case---central Antarctica. All in all, it seems like the
odds of landing somewhere with human artifacts in view are about one in four to
one in three---and that artifact will usually be either a field of crops or a
dirt road.
Look down
If you find yourself on a beach, check the sand. Sand all over the world
contains tiny grains of plastic, mostly from industrial spillage into the
oceans.[2]Patricia L. Corcorana, Mark C. Biesinger, Meriem Griï¬, Plastics_and
beaches:_A_degrading_relationship. Even if you land in the water, you might
still be able to spot bits of plastic debris; the ocean is covered with them,
which leads to heartbreaking_consequences.
Sample the air
If you have a CO2 meter---and you know Earth's atmospheric history---you can
also detect the changes we've made to the air around you. Over the past hundred
years, we've rapidly increased CO2 concentrations from less than 300 parts per
million to over 400---higher than they've been in millions of years. It's not
proof of technological activity, but it's a pretty good tip-off that something
weird is going on.
More sensitive testing could detect human-generated aerosols, or---by testing
the soils---detect the alterations we've made to the global nitrogen cycle.
[3]'Although carbon dioxide may get more press, "the nitrogen cycle has been
altered more than any other basic element cycle," says John Aber, vice
president for research and public service at the University of New Hampshire.'

Look up
Depending on the humidity, you may have a good chance of seeing jet contrails.
Under the right conditions, these water vapor trails from planes can linger for
hours. In many_parts_of_the_world, they're a common sight. However, in areas
with fewer flight paths---central Africa, South America, and Australia, in
particular---they might be less easy to spot.

But even if you find yourself in the middle of the Algerian_desert, the
Peruvian_Amazon, or the Arctic_cliffs_of_Transfiguration_Island, there's an
easy way to see evidence of intelligent life:
Wait for nightfall.[4]And then go crazy and burn down your civilization when
you see the stars for the first time.
At any given time, there are hundreds of satellites in the sky. Most of them
are too faint to see, but if you're in an area without much light pollution,
and you look carefully enough, there's virtually always a satellite visible.
Their rapid motion across the sky and various highly inclined orbits make them
unlikely to be anything but artificial.
It's often said that the Great Wall of China is the only human artifact that
can be seen from space. This is wrong.
But in my opinion, the real problem with this factoid isn't that it's
wrong---it's that it overlooks a much cooler point. The Great Wall of China may
not be the only artifact on Earth that you can see from a satellite ... but our
satellites are the only human artifacts that you can see from everywhere on
Earth.
