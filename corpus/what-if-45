Is this the most expensive music video ever?
---Various Youtube commenters
For starters, a big welcome home to Chris Hadfield, who returned to Earth last
night after a memorable stint as commander of the International Space Station.
Commander Hadfield's video_performance_of_Space_OddityÂ was an instant hit,
and prompted many commenters to ask whether it should count as the most
expensive music video ever made.
At a total lifetime cost in the neighborhood of \$150 billion [1], the
International Space Station is one of the world's most expensive
megaprojects. (The exact cost is hard to pin down, since the countries
contributing don't all handle their finances the same way.)
By comparison, the most expensive music videos have production budgets in the
range of a few million dollars. If Commander Hadfield's video gets the
ISS's entire \$150 billion price tag, then it must be tens of thousands of
times more expensive than the runner-up, right?
Not so fast.
The ISS is expensive, but there have been music videos set against an even
moreÂ expensive backdrop.
At a cost of roughly \$400 billion, the US Eisenhower Interstate Highway System
is probably the most expensive peacetime public works project in the history of
mankind. If we're including the entire ISS in the cost of Commander
Hadfield's video, any video shot on the American highway system should get
the cost of the highway system added to its total.
By that measure, the commander's video would lose to U2's Last Night on
Earth, which was filmed on a section of I-670 in Missouri,[2]Â and therefore
cost more than the ISS and the Moon landing program combined.
In both cases, the comparison doesn't really make sense; both the ISS and the
US highway system are used for things other than making music videos.[citation

of Hadfield's video.
If you spread out the ISS's price tag across all the astronaut-hours spent on
board, you come up with about \$7.5 million per person per day, or roughly \$90
per second.[3]Â That sounds like a lot, but at that rate, the five-and-a-half-
minute video only runs about \$30,000. Given that the video has probably done
more for space industry than millions in public outreach, that's a good deal.
Hadfield's son confirmed that Hadfield shot the video himself with no help
from other astronauts, so even if we assume he spent several hours setting it
up and recording it, we don't come close to the \$7 million cost of the
videoÂ Michael and Janet Jackson made for Scream.
And the truth is, this isn't a very good way to calculate costs either.
Presumably, Commander Hadfield isn't busy commanding things 24/7. He has some
free time, and it's no skin off anyone's back how he spends it (assuming
his hobby isn't drilling holes in walls). It's hard to argue that shooting
the video cost anyone \$90/second when he was going to be up there floating
around anyway.

Alternately, we could look at how much Commander Hadfield was paidÂ to make the
video. As a Canadian astronaut, his salary is somewhere between \$145,200 and
\$171,000 CAD.[4]Â Astronaut work hours are a little atypical, but if we assume
that in the long run he's on the job 40 hours a week, that works out to \$85/
hour. By that measure, the cost of the video was \$7.84. Not 7.84 million; 7
dollars and 84 cents (\$7.76 US).

And then there's the guitar.
While it's hard to argue that the entire cost of the ISS counts toward the
video, we could at least include the cost to launch the guitar. The LarrivÃ©e
Parlor acoustic guitar in the video went up years ago on the Space Shuttle, and
astronauts have been playing it ever since.[5]Â Given that launch costs at the
time were between \$20,000 and \$30,000 per pound, the cost to send up the
guitar was probably in the neighborhood of \$75,000.
While that's far from the most anyone's paid for a guitar,[6]Â it's
certainly a lot of money. And if playing music helps the astronauts relax and
keep from going crazy while they're crammed together in a tin can for months
at a time, it's probably a worthwhile investment.
Of course, this plan could backfire.
