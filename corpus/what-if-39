How hard would a puck have to be shot to be able to knock the goalie himself
backwards into the net?
---Tom
This can't really happen.
It's not just a problem of hitting it hard enough. This blog isn't
concernedÂ with that kind of limitation. Humans with sticks can't make a puck
go much faster than about_50_meters_per_second, so we'llÂ assume this puck is
launched by a hockey_robotÂ or an electric_sledÂ or a hypersonic_light_gas_gun.
The problem, in a nutshell, is that hockey players are heavy and pucks are not.
A goalie in full gear outweighs a puck by a factor of about 600. Even the
fastest slap shot has less momentum than a ten-year-old skating along at a mile
per hour.
Hockey players also can brace pretty hard against the ice. A player skating at
full speed can stop in the space of a few meters, which means the force
they're exerting on the ice is pretty substantial. (It also suggests that if
you started to slowly tilt a hockey rink, it could get up to 50 degrees before
the players would all slide to one end. Clearly, experiments are needed to
confirm this.)
From estimates of collision speeds in hockey_videos, and some guidance from a
hockey player friend, I estimated that the 165-gram puck would have to be
moving somewhere between Mach 2 and Mach 8 to knock the goalie backward into
the goal---faster if the goalie is bracing against the hit, and slower if the
puck hits at an upward angle.
Firing an object at Mach 8 is not, in itself, very hard. One of the best
methods for doing so is the aforementioned hypersonic_gas_gun, which is---at
its core---the same mechanism a BB gun uses to fire BBs.

But a hockey puck moving at Mach 8 will have a lot of problems. It's not on
the same scale as a relativistic baseball, but the air ahead of the puck would
be compressed and heated very rapidly. It wouldn't be going fast enough to
ionize the air and leave a glowing trail like a meteor, but the surface of the
puck would (given enough time) start to melt or char.
The air resistance, however, will slow the puck down very quickly, so a puck
going at Mach 8 when it leaves the launcher might be going a fraction of that
when it arrives at the goal. And even at Mach 8, the puck probably wouldn't
pass through the goalie's body. Instead, it would burst apart on impact with
the power of a large firecracker or small stick of dynamite.
If you're like me, when you first saw this question, you might've imagined
the puck leaving a cartoon-style hockey-puck-shaped hole. But that's because
our intuitions are shaky about how materials react at very high speeds.
Instead, a different mental picture might be more accurate: Imagine throwing a
ripe tomato---as hard as you can---at a cake.

That's about what would happen.
