If an asteroid was very small but supermassive, could you really live on it
like the Little Prince?

Last week, we looked at at life on a giant_world. This week, let's look at a
small one.

The Little Prince, by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, is a story about a traveler
from a distant asteroid. It's simple and sad and poignant and memorable.[1]For
another take on the Petit Prince, scroll down to the last section of this
wonderful_piece by Mallory Ortberg. It's ostensibly a children's book, but it's
hard to pin down who the intended audience is. In any case, it certainly has
found an audience; it's among the best-selling books in history.

It was written in 1942. That's an interesting time to write about asteroids,
because in 1942 we didn't actually know what asteroids looked like. Even in our
best telescopes, the largest asteroids were only visible as points of light. In
fact, that's where their name comes from---the word asteroid means &quot;star-
like.&quot;
We got our first confirmation of what asteroids looked like in 1971, when
Mariner 9 visited Mars and snapped pictures of Phobos and Deimos.[2]Here's a
picture of Phobos looking like the archetypical asteroid. The archived images
from the mission are at the NASA_Space_Science_Data_Center, but strangely, the
NSSDC refers readers to someone's personal Tripod_page to browse the actual
images. These moons, believed to be captured asteroids,[3]Ironically, while
Phobos and Deimos look like asteroids, new research suggests they're not. See
Craddock, Robert A.. &quot;Are_Phobos_And_Deimos_The_Result_Of_A_Giant
Impact?&quot;. Icarus (2010) solidified the modern image of asteroids as
cratered potatoes.

Before the 1970s, it was common for science fiction to assume small asteroids
would be round, like planets.[4]Not always; plenty of people had a good idea of
what they would look like. And there were stranger_ideas ...
The Little Prince took this a step further, imagining an asteroid as a tiny
planet with gravity, air, and a rose. There's no point in trying to critique
the science here, because (1) it's not a story about asteroids, and (2) it
opens with a parable about how foolish adults are for looking at everything too
literally.
So rather than trying to take things away from the story, let's see what
strange new pieces science can add. If there really were a superdense asteroid
with enough surface gravity to walk around on, it would have some pretty
surprising properties.
If the asteroid has a radius of 1.75 meters, then in order to have Earth-like
gravity at the surface, it would need to have a mass of about 500 million tons.
This is roughly equal to the combined mass of every human on Earth.
If you stood on the surface, you'd experience tidal forces. Your feet would
feel heavier than your head, which you'd feel as a gentle stretching sensation.
It would feel like you were stretched out on a curved rubber ball, or were
lying on a merry-go-round with your head near the center.

The escape velocity at the surface would be about 5 meters per second. That's
slower than a sprint, but still pretty fast. As a rule of thumb, if you can't
dunk a basketball, you wouldn't be able to escape by jumping straight up.

However, the weird thing about escape velocity is that it doesn't matter which
direction you're going.[5]... which is why it should really be called
&quot;escape speed&quot;---the fact that it has no direction (which is the
distinction between &quot;speed&quot; and &quot;velocity&quot;) is actually
very significant here. If you go faster than the escape speed, as long as you
don't actually go toward the planet, you'll escape. That means you might be
able to leave our asteroid by running horizontally and jumping off the end of a
ramp.

If you didn't go fast enough to escape the planet, you'd go into orbit around
it. Your orbital speed would be roughly 3 meters per second, which is a typical
jogging speed.

But this would be a weird orbit.
Tidal forces would act on you in several ways. If you reach your arm down
toward the planet, it would be pulled much harder than the rest of you. And if
you reach down with one arm, the rest of you gets pushed upward, which means
other parts of your body feel even less gravity. Effectively, every part of
your body would be trying to go in a different orbit.
A large orbiting object under these kinds of tidal forces---say, a moon---will
generally break apart into rings. This wouldn't happen to you. However, your
orbit would become chaotic and unstable.
These types of orbits were investigated in an interesting paper by Radu D.
Rugescu and Daniele Mortari.[6]Rugescu, Radu D., Mortari, Daniele, &quot;Ultra
Long_Orbital_Tethers_Behave_Highly_Non-Keplerian_and_Unstable&quot;, WSEAS
Transactions on Mathematics, Vol. 7, No. 3, March 2008, pp. 87-94. Their
simulations showed that large, elongated objects follow strange patterns around
their central bodies. Even their centers of mass don't move in the traditional
ellipses; some adopt pentagonal orbits, while others spin chaotically and crash
into the planet.

This type of analysis could actually have practical applications. There have
been various proposals over the years to use long, whirling tethers to move
cargo in and out of gravity wells---a sort of free-floating space_elevator.
Such tethers could transport cargo to and from the surface of the Moon, or to
pick up spacecraft from the edge of the Earth's atmosphere. The inherent
instability of many tether orbits poses an interesting challenge for this kind
of project.
As for the residents of our superdense asteroid, they'd have to be careful; if
they ran too fast, they'd be in serious danger of going into a tumble and
losing their lunch.
Fortunately, vertical jumps would be fine.
