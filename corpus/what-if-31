When - if ever - will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?
---Johan Ãbrink
     Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes
     hurtling down the highway.
     âAndrew Tanenbaum, 1981
If you want to transfer a few hundred gigabytes of data, it's generally
faster to FedEx a hard drive than to send the files over the internet. This
isn't a new idea---it's often dubbed SneakerNet---and it's how Google
transfers_large_amounts_of_data_internally.
But will it always be faster?
Cisco estimatesÂ that total internet traffic currently averages 167 terabits
per second. FedEx has a fleet of 654 aircraft with a lift_capacity_of_26.5
million_pounds_daily. A solid-state laptop drive weighs about_78_gramsÂ and can
hold up to a terabyte.
That means FedEx is capable of transferring 150 exabytes of data per day, or 14
petabits per second---almost a hundred times the current throughput of the
internet.

If you don't care about cost, this ten-kilogram shoebox can hold a lot of
internet
We can improve the data density even further by using MicroSD cards:

Those thumbnail-sized flakes have a storage density of up to 160 terabytes per
kilogram, which means a FedEx fleet loaded with MicroSD cards could transfer
about 177 petabits per second, or two zettabytes per day---a thousand times the
internet's current traffic level. (The infrastructure would be
interesting---Google would need to build huge warehouses to hold a_massive
card-processing_operation.)
Cisco estimates internet traffic is growing at about 29% annually. At that
rate, we'd hit the FedEx point in 2040. Of course, the amount of data we can
fit on a drive will have gone up by then, too. The only way to actually reach
the FedEx point is if transfer rates grow much faster than storage rates. In an
intuitive sense, this seems unlikely, since storage and transfer are
fundamentally linked---all that data is coming from somewhere and going
somewhere---but there's no way to Â predict usage patterns for sure.
While FedEx is big enough to keep up with the next few decades of actual usage,
there's no technological reason we can't build a connection that beats them
on bandwidth. There are experimental fiber clusters that can handle_over_a
petabit_per_second. A cluster of 200 of those would beat FedEx.
If you recruited the entire US_freight_industryÂ to move SD cards for you, the
throughput would be on the order of 500 exabits---half a zettabit---per second.
To match that transfer rate digitally, you'd need take half a million of
those petabit cables.
So the bottom line is that for raw bandwidth, the internet will probably never
beat SneakerNet. Of course, the virtually infinite bandwidth would come at the
cost of 80,000,000-millisecond ping times.
