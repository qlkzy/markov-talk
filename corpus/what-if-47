Let's assume there's life on the the nearest habitable exoplanet and that they
have technology comparable to ours. If they looked at our star right now, what
would they see?

Let's try a more complete answer. We'll start with ...
Radio transmissions
ContactÂ popularized the idea of aliens listening in on our transmissions.
Sadly, the odds are against it.
Here's the problem: Space is big. Really big.[1]
You can work through the physics of interstellar radio attenuation, but the
problem is captured pretty well by considering the economics of the situation:
If your TV signals are getting to another star, you're losing money. Powering
a transmitter is expensive, and creatures on other stars aren't buying the
products in the TV commercials that pay your electricity bill.
The full picture is more complicated, but the bottom line is that as our
technology has advanced, less of our radio traffic has been leaking out into
space. We're closing down the giant transmitting antennas and switching to
cable and fiber and tightly-focused cell-tower networks.[2]
While our TV signals may have been detectable---with great effort---for a
while,[3]Â that window is closing. In the late 20th century, when we were using
TV and radio to scream into the void at the top of our lungs, the signal
probably faded to undetectability after a few light-years.[4]Â The potentially
habitable exoplanets we've spotted so far are dozens of light-years away, so
the odds are they aren't currently repeating_our_catchphrases.
But TV and radio transmissions still weren't Earth's most powerful radio
signal. They were outshone by the beams from early-warning radar.[4]
Early-warning radar, a product of the Cold War, consisted of a bunch of ground
and airborne stations scattered around the Arctic. These stations swept the
atmosphere with powerful radar beams 24/7, often bouncing them off the
ionosphere, and people obsessively monitored the echos for any hints of enemy
movement. (I wasn't alive during most of this period, but from what I hear,
the mood was a little tense.)
These radar transmissions leaked into space, and could probably be picked up by
nearby exoplanets[5]Â if they happened to be listening when the beam swept over
their part of the sky. But the same march of technological progress that made
the TV broadcast towers obsolete has had the same effect on early-warning
radar. Today's systems---where they exist at all---are much quieter, and may
eventually be replaced completely by new technology.

Earth's most powerfulÂ radio signal is the beam from the Arecibo telescope.
This massive dish in Puerto Rico can function as a radar transmitter, bouncing
a signal off nearby targets like Mercury and the asteroid belt. It's
essentially a flashlight which we shine on planets to see them better. (This is
just as crazy as it sounds.)
But it transmits only occasionally, and in a narrow beam. If an exoplanet
happened to be caught in the beam, and they were lucky enough to be pointing a
receiving antenna at our corner of the sky at the time, all they would pick up
would be a_brief_pulse_of_radio_energy,_then_silence.
So hypothetical aliens looking at Earth probably wouldn't pick us up with
radio antennas.
But there's also ...
Visible light
This is more promising. The Sun is really bright [citation_needed]Â and its
light illuminates the Earth.[citation_needed] Some of that light is reflected
back into space as "Earthshine". Some of it skims close to our planet and
passes through our atmosphere before continuing on to the stars. Both of these
effects could potentially be detected from an exoplanet.[4][6]
They wouldn't tell you anything about humans directly, but if you watched the
Earth for long enough, you could figure out a lot about our atmosphere from the
reflectivity. You could probably figure out what our water cycle looked like,
and our oxygen-rich atmosphere would give you a hint that something_weird_was
going_on.
So in the end, the clearest signal from Earth might not be from us at all. It
might be from the algae that have been terraforming the planet---and altering
the signals we send into space---for billions of years.

Of course, if we wanted to send a clearer signal, we could. A radio
transmission has the problem that they have to be paying attention when it
arrives.
Instead, we could makeÂ them pay attention. With ion drives, nuclear pulse
propulsion, or just clever use of gravitational slingshots, we could probably
send a probe out of the Solar System fast enough to reach a given nearby star
in a few dozen millennia. If we can figure out how to make a guidance system
that survives the trip (which would be tough) we could use it to steer toward
any inhabited planet.
To land safely, we'd have to slow down. But slowing down takes even more
fuel. And, hey, the whole point of this was for them to notice us, right?
So maybe if those aliens looked toward our Solar System, this is what they'd
see:
