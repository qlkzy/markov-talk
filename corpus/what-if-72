What is the furthest one human being has ever been from every other living
person? Were they lonely?
Bryan J. McCarter
It's hard to know for sure!
The most likely suspects are the six Apollo command module pilots who stayed in
lunar orbit during a Moon landing: Mike Collins, Dick Gordon, Stu Roosa, Al
Worden, Ken Mattingly, and Ron Evans.
Each of these astronauts stayed alone in the command module while two other
astronauts landed on the Moon. At the highest point in their orbit, they were
about 3,585 kilometers from their fellow astronauts.

You'd think astronauts would have a lock on this category, but it's not so cut-
and-dry. There are a few other candidates who come pretty close!
****** Polynesians ******
It's hard to get 3,585 kilometers[1]Because of the curve of the Earth, you
actually have to go 3,619 kilometers across the surface to qualify. from a
permanently inhabited place. The Polynesians, who were the first humans to
spread across the Pacific, might have managed it, but this would have required
a lone sailor to travel awfully far ahead of everyone else. It may have
happened---perhaps by accident, when someone was carried far from their group
by a storm---but we're unlikely to ever know for sure.
Once the Pacific was colonized, it got a lot harder to find regions of the
Earth's surface where someone could achieve 3,585 kilometer isolation. Now that
the Antarctic continent has a permanent population of researchers, it's almost
certainly impossible.
****** Antarctic explorers ******
During the period of Antarctic exploration, a few people have come close to
beating the astronauts, and it's possible one of them actually holds the
record. One person who came very close was Robert Scott.
Robert Falcon Scott was a British explorer who met a tragic end. Scott's
expedition reached the South Pole in 1911, only to discover that Norwegian
explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten him there by several months. The dejected
Scott and his companions began their trek back to the coast, but they all died
while crossing the Ross Ice Shelf.
The last surviving expedition member would have been, briefly, one of the most
isolated people on Earth.[2]Amundsen's expedition had left the continent by
then. However, he (whoever he was) was still within 3,585 kilometers of a
number of humans, including some other Antarctic explorer outposts as well as
the MÄori on Rakiura (Stewart Island) in New Zealand.
There are plenty of other candidates. Pierre FranÃ§ois PÃ©ron, a French sailor,
says he was marooned on Ãle Amsterdam in the southern Indian Ocean. If so, he
came close to beating the astronauts, but he wasn't quite far enough from
Mauritius, southwestern Australia, or the edge of Madagascar to qualify.
We'll probably never know for sure. It's possible that some shipwrecked 18th-
century sailor drifting in a lifeboat in the Southern Ocean holds the title of
most isolated human. However, until some clear piece of historic evidence pops
up, I think the six Apollo astronauts have a pretty good claim.
Which brings us to the second part of Bryan's question: Were they lonely?
****** Loneliness ******
After returning to Earth, Apollo 11 command module pilot Mike Collins said he
did not feel at all lonely. He wrote about the experience in his book Carrying
the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys:
     Far from feeling lonely or abandoned, I feel very much a part of what
     is taking place on the lunar surface ... I don't mean to deny a
     feeling of solitude. It is there, reinforced by the fact that radio
     contact with the Earth abruptly cuts off at the instant I disappear
     behind the moon.
     I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known
     life. I am it. If a count were taken, the score would be three
     billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God
     knows what on this side.
Al Worden, the Apollo 15 command module pilot, even enjoyed the experience:
[3]BBC Future interview_with_Al_Wolden (April 2, 2013)
     There's a thing about being alone and there's a thing about being
     lonely, and they're two different things. I was alone but I was not
     lonely. My background was as a fighter pilot in the air force, then
     as a test pilotâand that was mostly in fighter airplanesâso I was
     very used to being by myself. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't have
     to talk to Dave and Jim any more ... On the backside of the Moon, I
     didn't even have to talk to Houston and that was the best part of the
     flight.
Introverts understand; the loneliest human in history was just happy to have a
few minutes of peace and quiet.
