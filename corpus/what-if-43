Could a high-speed train run through a vertical loop, like a rollercoaster,
with the passengers staying comfortable?
---Gero Walter
No.
Since this is kind of a disappointing answer, I tried relaxing the requirements
a little.
Could a high-speed train run through a vertical loop, like a rollercoaster,
with the passengers staying comfortable surviving?
Still no.
Could a modified and reinforced high-speed train with a jet engine on top run
through a vertical loop, like a rollercoaster, with the passengers staying
comfortable surviving?
Maybe.
The Norwegian aluminium and energy company Norsk Hydro ran a_pro-education_ad
in which a bunch of kids build a giant roller-coaster loop on a train track as
a prank. This is, of course, unrealistic, but not just for the obvious reasons.
There are some problems with the whole idea of sending high-speed trains
through loops.
The first issue is geometry. The biggest vertical loop which a train could
conceivably go around has a radius of about 200 meters. If it's any bigger
than that, even the fastest trains will fail to complete the loop.
Unfortunately, a 200 meter loop is much too tight. Most high-speed trains are
limited to vertical curves with radii no shorter than 20 kilometers.

The reason for those limits isn't that trains aren't bendy enough. It's how
fast they're going.
The spec sheet for the Bombardier_ZEFIRO, for example, says it can handle a
pretty tight vertical curve radius---just 900 meters. At the train's top
speed, that curve would create about two gees of acceleration. This might be
survivable (for the passengers, at least, if not the train), but it would
certainly not be comfortable.
Yet a 900 meter radius loop is still too big. Even with the engine at full
power, the train wouldn't even be able to get a quarter of the way around the
loop before sliding back down.

The CGI train in the Norwegian video is an Di_4, which is shown moving about
twice as fast as it can actually go. Based on its speed and number of cars, the
loop appears to have a radius of about 70 meters, which is part of why it's
shown going so fast---the actual Di 4 would be just a little too slow, and
would fall off the track at the top. The digital one, however, makes it around
the loop in about five seconds, no problem.
But the tight loop means the passengers and train are experiencing between 9
and 15 gees. This is at the limit of what fighter pilots can handle in pressure
suits. In addition to killing everyone on board, it would certainly destroy the
train, to say nothing of the track. 70 meters is much too tight.
Clearly, we need a larger loop. 900 meters would be great, but our trains
aren't fast enough for that.\
But maybe we could make the train go faster ...
Hmm.

Believe it or not, this has been tried before---a number of countries have
built jet-engine-powered_trains. Sadly, they never took off. Fortunately, they
never took off.
A 747 engine mounted atop a bullet train would probably add about 35% to its
speed. Is that enough to do a 900-meter loop?

Nope.
Ok, putting the jet engine on top didn't work. Maybe we should try something
different.

... why did we think that would work? Forget that idea.
Clearly, we need some combination of a fast train and a medium-sized loop. The
sweet spot for loop size and shape is probably something like this:

Of course, given the height, we'd probably have to build it into a small
mountain:

The shape of the loop, which is common in roller coasters, would spread out the
g-forces more evenly, resulting in a max of only a few gees---totally
survivable!
Of course, the construction costs would be astronomical, and it goes without
saying that no group of kids could pull it off alone without the resources of a
major government.
To any Norwegian kids reading this who were hoping to build a train loop, don't
despair---there may still be a way to make this happen.
The US Vice President, Joe Biden, served in the US Senate for 36 years. In all
that time, he never moved to Washington, DC. Instead, every night, he took the
train home to Delaware to see his family. This is very touching, but after the
first few years, I'm sure the commute got a little dull.
So, if you're looking for a high-level backer to help you make someone's
train ride a little more exciting, you might just try talking to Joe.
