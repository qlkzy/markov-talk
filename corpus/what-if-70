How big of a lawn would you have to have so that when you finished mowing you'd
need to start over because the grass has grown?
Nick Nelson
According to the Turfgrass_Extension_and_Outreach program at UIUC,[1]The Morrow
cornfields operated by the university are the most valuable cornfields in the
world, and part of one of the world's longest-running scientific experiments.
every mowing should remove one third of the grass blade's height.

Grass grows slower or faster depending on the weather, but we'll assume an
average growth rate of 0.2 inches per day. This figure comes from Mowing_Your
Lawn, a document published by by Iowa State's Yard_and_Garden_Extension program
(which, I like to imagine, has a vicious and occasionally bloody rivalry with
the UIUC Turfgrass crew).
A typical pushmower at a fast walking speed can mow a little under a square
meter per second. If you mowed without stopping from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, you
would cover about 25,000 square meters.[2]or 6 acres, or 2.5 hectares, or 7,500
square fathoms, or 8,500 square smoots, or 5,300 Shrouds of Turin To maintain
your lawn at a height of four inches, you would need to mow it every ten days.
If you mowed more or less frequently, you could risk damaging the lawn---or,
worse, incur the wrath of UIUC.
At ten hours of mowing per day, you could cover a quarter of a square kilometer
before you'd have to circle back to the beginning and start over. If the entire
area of Vatican City, indoors and out, were covered in perennial ryegrass,
[3]Perhaps due to an ill-advised UIUC undergraduate project you would be able
to keep about half of it neatly trimmed.

You could improve on this with a larger, faster mower. An oversized rider mower
at 12 miles per hour[4]The maximum listed in the Cub_Cadet_rider_mower_acres-
per-hour_chart  could mow as much as two square kilometers, which Wolfram|Alpha
helpfully_tells_me is 0.5% to 1% of an adult male cougar's home range.

In 2010, Bobby Cleveland set a world record for the top speed in a riding
lawnmower, hitting 96 mph. This record was set as part of a rivalry with the
British lawnmower driver Don Wales.[5]Really.
In a blow to its national pride, the US has lost that record. Sometime in the
last few years, the magazine Top Gear commissioned Honda to build them an even
faster lawnmower. A few months ago, this mower---which shoots flames from the
exhaust pipe---broke 100 mph on a test track in France.[6]&quot;First_tests_of
'130mph'_lawnmower&quot;, BBC News Technology, 17 July 2013 The builders claim
it will eventually reach 130 mph. The mower is still capable of cutting grass
(using a custom wire mechanism), but when running at top speed the trimmer is
removed for safety reasons.
With the Top Gear mower, what's the maximum area we could cut?
Let's set safety aside and assume we can leave the mower's cutting mechanism in
place. Let's also assume that the mower can cut a strip two meters wide while
running at top speed.
Under those assumptions, if the mower is run for 24 hours a day, seven days a
week ...

... it could just about keep one adult male cougar's home range neatly trimmed.
