With today's technology, would it be possible to launch an unmanned mission to
retrieve Voyager I?
---Elliott Bennett
Voyager IÂ is farther from Earth than any other manmade object. After getting a
pair of gravitational kicks from Jupiter and Saturn, it's headed out of the
Solar System at a pretty high speed, and nothing else we've built is on track
to pass it.
Strangely, as of the day I'm writing this, VoyagerÂ is actually getting
closerÂ to us, because Earth is in a part of its orbit where it's approaching
VoyagerÂ faster than VoyagerÂ is fleeing. But in a few months, we'll swing
around the Sun and VoyagerÂ will again be getting farther away.

It has a 35-year head start, so it would be hard to catch. But catching up
isn't the problem.
New Horizons, the spacecraft currently headed out of the Solar System by way of
Pluto, is never going to catch up to Voyager---it's not moving fast enough
and it's headed in the wrong direction.Â But it could have.
The reason VoyagerÂ is moving so fast is that it got gravitational assists from
Jupiter and Saturn, while New HorizonsÂ only got one from Jupiter.

Gravity assists aren't paradoxical magic. It's just like bouncing a tennis
ball off a passing truck. Gyroscopes, on the other hand, ARE magic.
If New HorizonsÂ had ditched the Pluto objective and waited for the right
planetary alignment (the 2030s look promising), it could have swung by Jupiter
and Saturn, then caught up to VoyagerÂ in as little as a century or two!
(Assuming we could manage to hit Voyager from that far away. But I bet we
could; our rocket scientists are pretty good at rocket science.)
Of course, getting there's the easy part. The hard part is getting back.
VoyagerÂ weighs a little less than a ton and is moving away at 17 kilometers
per second (if it were in the atmosphere, that would be Mach 50). And since
it's out in interstellar space, there are no speeding Jupiters to grab on to.
Stopping VoyagerÂ is going to take a lotÂ of fuel.
It's what engineers call the tyranny_of_the_rocket_equation: As the amount
that you want to change your speed ("delta-v") goes up, the fuel required
increases exponentially. The equation tells us that to turn the 720-kilogram
VoyagerÂ around, we're going to need at least 30Â tonsÂ of fuel.
But to get thatÂ fuel out there, we need even moreÂ fuel. And to get
thatÂ fuel, we need even moreÂ fuel. (This is where the tyrannical rocket
equation gets its exponential term.) In fact, to rescue Voyager, we'd have to
launch a fleet of---at minimum---60 New Horizons-sized spacecraft loaded with
nothing but fuel.
Could we do it? Sure. There are a couple plausible ways. Instead of building
five to ten dozen fuel-laden Titan IIIEs, we could just build a fleet of ten or
fifteen Saturn Vs, and do the whole thing with fewer launches. But however we
did it, it would be a massive and expensive operation similar in scale to the
Apollo program.
The difference between the launch vehicle we'd used to get Voyager out of the
Solar System and the fleet we'd need for a round trip is striking:

Fortunately, there's one way around the tyranny of the rocket equation: Ditch
the rockets.
Ion engines---which use electric fields to accelerate exhaust gas to high
speeds---are far more efficient than chemical rockets, and they make
accelerating to high speeds much more plausible.
The reason we're not using them for everything is that they produce very
little thrust, so it takes a long time to get up to speed. It's like if you
had a car that gets amazing mileage but has a one-horsepower engine. (Actually,
are you sure that's not just a horse?) Ion engines are great; the current
ones just take forever to get you moving.
But since catching VoyagerÂ is going to take a long time anyway, ion engines
are fine. We could launch a probe (like this_one), send it out to Voyager,
latch on, turn everything around, and let it spend a few decades slowing
Voyagerdown.
Once Voyager had lost nearly all its speed, the Sun's gravity would take
over, and the probe would begin a long slow slide toward the inner Solar
System. This would take about 200 years, and with some extremely careful
nudges, we could make sure it falls in an Earth-crossing orbit.
Two centuries later, VoyagerÂ would reach Earth and, with no way to slow down,
burn up in our atmosphere, because we didn't think to send out an aerobraking
shell with the rescue craft. So that was a waste of a few centuries of work and
billions upon billions of dollars.

Maybe a better idea would be to borrow a salvage vessel and set sail for the
coast of New South Wales, Australia. There, in the waters off Jervis Bay, the
Australian Royal Navy ship VoyagerÂ sank in 1964 after an accidental collision.
That one's probably easier to retrieve.
