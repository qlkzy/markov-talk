******_Leap_Seconds_******
Every now and then we have to insert a leap second because the Earth's
rotation is slowing down. Could we speed up Earth's rotation, so that we do
not need Leap Seconds?
---Anton (Berlin, Germany)
The Earth's spin is slowing down. This is annoying.
One reason that it's annoying is that it makes time standards more difficult.
We already have way_too_many_time_standards, including:
    * TAI, time based on an atomic clock, which ignores all motion of the Earth
    * UT0Â and UT1, time based on precise measurement of the Earth's rotation
    * GPS, the time standard used by GPS satellites
    * UTC, the standard used in computing, which is like TAIÂ but with leap
      seconds to keep it in sync with Earth
    * TDT, TBT, TCB, andÂ TCG,Â which are all even worse
This leads to all kinds of little headaches, particularly for programmers. For
example, the clock in your smartphone's GPS is 16 seconds out of sync with
the phone's system clock. This is because the system clock uses Coordinated
Universal Time (which has leap seconds), but GPS time doesn't. They were in
sync in January of 1980 and probably never will be again.
Half a billion years ago (when the Earth was 4 billion years old, instead of
4.5), each day was 22 hours long instead of 24. The day has gotten longer
because of tidal forces from the Moon.
Loosely speaking, here's how tidal drag works: The Moon's tides raise
bulges in the Earth, but the Earth's rotation moves those bulges out of line
with the Moon. The Moon's gravity tries to tug the bulges back into line,
which exerts a twisting force on the Earth, slowing it down:

Strangely, the Earth is actually not slowing down as much as you'd expect
from tidal drag. The biggest reason for the discrepancy is that during the last
ice age, the continents were pushed down by the weight of the glaciers, and
they're still springing back into place. This has the effect of shifting mass
toward the poles, closer to the axis of rotation:

This makes us spin faster---or, at least, keeps us from slowing down as
quickly.
At the moment, each day is about 0.8 milliseconds longer than the 86,400
seconds it needs to be to avoid adding leap seconds.

This difference fluctuates over time based on weather and other effects (it's
actually shortened a bit since the early 1990s), although in the long run, it
will definitely get larger as the Earth slows.
If we wanted to get rid of leap seconds, we'd need to keep the Earth spinning
at a more constant rate. This means speeding up the Earth and shortening each
day by about 0.8 milliseconds.
This is a tough problem. Here are a few things that won't work:
Spinning_counterclockwiseÂ in a chair. It temporarily alters the Earth's rate
of rotation, but not enough to matter.
Putting rocket engines on the Equator.Â This won't work because the exhaust
would go into the atmosphere, which transmits the force back to the ground as
wind drag---it'd be like making a bike go forward by pushing on the
handlebars. If the engines were somehow mounted above the atmosphere, they'd
be able to slow the Earth, but not by enough to accomplish our goal.
Triggering big earthquakes.Â ThisÂ can alter_the_length_of_the_day, but even
those aren't big enough to make a difference.
In the end, there's only one solution: Hitting the Earth with asteroids.
Given enough time, we could send a spaceship (captained by an anti-Bruce
Willis) to perform repeated flybys of a comet. Over time, the gravitational
perturbation could steer the comet into a collision course with Earth. By
hitting the Earth at the right angle, we would give it a push:

Even if the comet burns up in the atmosphere, its momentum is transmitted to
the surface by wind drag (taking a matter of days). It takes about_a
decadeÂ for the core to sync up with the crust, so we'd have to plan the
impact schedule carefully to avoid overshooting.
Here's the bad news: To get enough spin, we have to hit the Earth with on the
order of a billion liters of rock per second (several times the volumetric
discharge rate of the Amazon). This adds up to about one six-mile dinosaur-
killing asteroid every couple days. Humanity---and life---wouldn't survive
the bombardment long.
What about a steady stream of smaller asteroids?

If asteroid B-612 in The Little Prince is four meters across and made of rock,
we'd need an average of around fifty thousand of them to enter the atmosphere
each second to keep up the pressure.

Unfortunately, the steady high-altitude meteor shower would deliver just as
much energy to the atmosphere that daily giant impacts would, and the eventual
death toll would be the same: Seven billion humans, plus four billion Little
Princes per day.
But at least we could stop worrying about leap seconds.
