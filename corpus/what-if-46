I've been told that if the Earth were shrunk down to the size of a bowling
ball, it would be smoother than said bowling ball. My question is, what would a
bowling ball look like if it were blown up to the size of the Earth?

A good, professional-quality bowling ball is smoother than the Earth.
Phil Plait, of Bad Astronomy, took a look at the claim that the Earth was
smoother than a billiard ball. He concluded_that_the_Earth_was_smoother_but
less_round, based on published billiard ball roundness tolerances. However, he
couldn't find any information on the size and shape of a billiard ball's
pits and bumps.
Fortunately for us, there are people who digitally_scan_bowling_ball_surfaces.

These scans (along with various measurements of ball roughness[1] tell us that
a high-end bowling ball is quite smooth. If blown up to the scale of the Earth,
the ridges and bumps[2]Â would be between 10 and 200 meters high,Â and the
peaks would be between one and three kilometers apart:

By Earth standards, this is quite smooth; our highest mountains are 40 times
higher.
What would this bowling ball world (we'll call it "Lebowski") be like?
For starters, bowling balls are a lot less dense than rock, so Lebowski's
surface gravity would be a quarter the strength of Earth's:

It would also (at first) have no atmosphere.

The finger holes would be about a thousand kilometers across and a few thousand
kilometers deep.

On Earth, holes this big would expose the molten interior. But Lebowski
doesn't have a molten interior.
The Earth's core is hot for two reasons: It's still glowing from the heat
of all the dust collapsing together when it formed, and it's full of
radioactive metals. Lebowski wouldn't have either of these, so its core would
start out cold.
The holes would be far too big to hold themselves open against gravity; On that
scale, the polymers in the bowling ball would behave more like a liquid. In the
space of about half an hour, the holes would undergo a slow-motion collapse.

As they collapsed, the material around the holes would heat to a glow. At the
center of the hole, a white-hot jet of charred hydrocarbons would fountain
outward into space.
When it was over, Lebowski would be left with massive scars, each marking the
location where an abyss collapsed to form a molten sea.

And now, thanks to this question, whenever I look at the Moon, I'll notice
the_Sea_of_Tranquility,_the_Sea_of_Serenity,_and_the_Sea_of_Crisis, and I'll
think: Finger holes.
But that's just, like, my opinion, man.
