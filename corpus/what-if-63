If all digital data were stored on punch cards, how big would Google's data
warehouse be?

Google almost certainly has more data storage capacity than any other
organization on Earth.
Google is very secretive about its operations, so it's hard to say for sure.
There are only a handful of organizations who might plausibly have more storage
capacity or a larger server infrastructure. Here's my short list of the top
contenders:
    * NSA
    * NRO
    * NGIP
    * CIA
    * Schlumberger
    * Tencent
    * Chevron
Honorable mentions:
    * Amazon (They're huge, but probably not as big as Google.)
    * Facebook (They're on the right scale and growing fast, but still playing
      catch-up.)
    * Microsoft (They have a million servers,[1]Data Center Knowledge:
      [Ballmer: Microsoft has 1 Million Servers although no one seems sure
      why.)
Let's take a closer look at Google's computing platform.
Follow the money
We'll start by following the money. Google's aggregate capital
expendituresâspending on building stuff[2]I'm excluding the cost of an
extremely expensive building they bought in New York.---adds up to somewhere
over $12 billion dollars.[3]Data Center Knowledge: Google's_Data_Center
Building_Boom_Continues:_$1.6_Billion_Investment_in_3_Months Their biggest data
centers cost half a billion to a billion dollars, so they can't have more than
20 or so of those.
On their website,[4]Data_center_locations Google acknowledges that they have
datacenters in the following locations:
   1. Berkeley County, South Carolina
   2. Council Bluffs, Iowa
   3. Atlanta, Georgia
   4. Mayes County, Oklahoma
   5. Lenoir, North Carolina
   6. The Dalles, Oregon
   7. Hong Kong
   8. Singapore
   9. Taiwan
  10. Hamina, Finland
  11. St Ghislain, Belgium
  12. Dublin, Ireland
  13. Quilicura, Chile
In addition, they appear to operate a number of other large datacenters
(sometimes through subsidiary corporations), including:
   1. Eemshaven, Netherlands
   2. Groningen, Netherlands
   3. Budapest, Hungary
   4. WrocÅaw, Poland
   5. Reston, Virginia
   6. Additional sites near Atlanta, Georgia
They also operate equipment at dozens to hundreds of smaller locations around
the world.
Follow the power
To figure out how many servers Google is running, we can look at their
electricity consumption. Unfortunately, we can't just sneak up to a datacenter
and read the meter.[5]Actually, wait, can we? Somebody should try that.
Instead, we have to do some digging.
The company disclosed that in 2010 they consumed an average of 258 megawatts of
power.[6]Google_used_2,259,998_MWh_of_electricity_in_2010, which translates to
an average of 258 megawatts. How many computers can they run with that?
We know that their datacenters are quite efficient, only spending 10-20% of
their power on cooling and other overhead.[7]Google: Efficiency:_How_we_do_it
To get an idea of how much power each server uses, we can look at their
&quot;container data center&quot; concept from 2005. It's not clear whether
they actually use these containers in practice---it may just have been a now-
outdated experiment---but it gives an idea of what they consider(ed) reasonable
power consumption. The answer: 215 watts per server.
Judging from that number, in 2010, they were operating around a million
servers.
They've grown a lot since then. By the end of 2013, the total amount of money
they've pumped into their datacenters will be three or four times what it was
as of 2010. They've contracted to buy over three hundred megawatts of power at
just three sites,[8]Google: Purchasing_clean_energy which is more than they
used for all their operations in 2010.
Based on datacenter power usage and spending estimates, my guess would be that
Google is currently running---or will soon be running---between 1.8 and 2.4
million servers.
But what do these &quot;servers&quot; actually represent? Google could be
experimenting in all kinds of wild ways, running boards with 100 cores or 100
attached disks. If we assume that each server has a couple[9]Anywhere_from_2_to
5 of 2 TB disks attached, we come up with close to 10 exabytes[10]As a
refresher, the order is: kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, exa, zetta, yotta. An
exabyte is a million terabytes. of active storage attached to running clusters.
10 Exabytes
The commercial hard disk industry ships about 8 exabytes worth of drives
annually.[12]IDC: Worldwide_External_Disk_Storage_Systems_Factory_Revenue
Declines_for_the_Second_Consecutive_Quarter Those numbers don't necessarily
include companies like Google, but in any case, it seems likely that Google is
a large piece of the global hard drive market.
To make things worse, given the huge number of drives they manage, Google has a
hard drive die every few minutes.[11]Eduardo Pinheiro, Wolf-Dietrich Weber and
Luiz Andre Barroso, [Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population This isn't
actually all that expensive a problem, in the grand scheme of things---they
just get good at replacing drives---but it's weird to think that when a Googler
runs a piece of code, they know that by the time it finishes executing, one of
the machines it was running on will probably have suffered a drive failure.
Google tape storage
Of course, that only covers storage attached to running servers. What about
&quot;cold&quot; storage? Who knows how much data Google---or anyone else---has
stored in basement archives?
In a 2011 phone interview with Paul Mah of SMB Tech, Simon Anderson of Tandberg
Data let slip[13]SMB Tech: Is_Tape_Still_Relevant_for_SMBs? that Google is the
world's biggest single consumer of magnetic tape cartridges, purchasing 200,000
per year. Assuming they've stepped up their purchasing since then as they've
expanded, this could add up to another few exabytes of tape archives.
Putting it all together
Let's assume Google has a storage capacity of 15 exabytes, or
15,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.
A punch card can hold about 80 characters, and a box of cards holds 2000 cards:
[/imgs/a/63/google_160kb.png]
15 exabytes of punch cards would be enough to cover my home region, New
England, to a depth of about 4.5 kilometers. That's three times deeper than the
ice sheets that covered the region during the last advance of the glaciers:

That seems like a lot.
However, it's nothing compared to the ridiculous claims by some news reports
about the NSA datacenter in Utah.
NSA datacenter
The NSA is building a datacenter in Utah. Media reports claimed that it could
hold up to a yottabyte of data,[14]CNET: NSA_to_store_yottabytes_in_Utah_data
centre which is patently absurd.
Later reports changed their minds, suggesting that the facility could only hold
on the order of 3-12 exabytes.[15]Forbes: Blueprints_Of_NSA's_Ridiculously
Expensive_Data_Center_In_Utah_Suggest_It_Holds_Less_Info_Than_Thought We also
know the facility uses about 65 megawatts of power,[16]Salt-Lake City Tribune:
NSA_Bluffdale_Center_won't_gobble_up_Utah's_power_supply which is about
what a large Google datacenter consumes.
A few headlines, rather than going with one estimate or the other, announced
that the facility could hold &quot;between an exabyte and a yottabyte&quot; of
data[17]Dailykos: Utah_Data_Center_stores_data_between_1_exabyte_and_1
yottabyte ... which is a little like saying &quot;eyewitnesses report that the
snake was between 1 millimeter and 1 kilometer long.&quot;
Uncovering further Google secrets
There are a lot of tricks for digging up information about Google's operations.
Ironically, many of them involve using Google itself---from Googling for job
postings in strange cities to using image search to find leaked cell camera
photos of datacenter visits.
However, the best trick for locating secret Google facilities might be the one
revealed by ex-Googler talentlessclown on reddit:[18]reddit: Can_r/Australia
help_find_Google's_Sydney_data_center?_Seems_like_a_bit_of_a_mystery...
     The easiest way to find manned Google data centres is to ask taxi
     drivers and pizza delivery people.
There's something pleasing about that. Google has created what might be the
most sophisticated information-gathering apparatus in the history of the Earth
... and the only people with information about them are the pizza delivery
drivers.
Who watches the watchers?
