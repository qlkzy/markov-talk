******_Random_Sneeze_Call_******
If you call a random phone number and say "God bless you", what are the
chances that the person who answers just sneezed? On average, not just in
spring or fall.
âMimi
It's hard to find good figures, but it's probably about 1 in 40,000.

Before you pick up the phone, you should also keep in mind that there's roughly
a 1 in 1,000,000,000 chance that the person you're calling just murdered
someone.[1]Based on a murder rate of 4 per 100,000, the average_in_the_US but
on the high end for industrialized countries. You may want to be careful when
you hand out blessings.
However, given that sneezes are far more common than murders,[2]Citation: You
are alive. you're still much more likely to get someone who sneezed than to
catch a killer, so this strategy is not recommended:

(Mental note: I'm going to start saying that when people sneeze.)
Compared with the murder rate, the sneezing rate doesn't get much scholarly
research. The most widely-cited figure for average sneeze frequency comes from
a doctor interviewed by ABC News, who pegged it at 200 sneezes per person per
year.[3]Cari Nierenberg, The_Perils_of_Sneezing, ABC News, Dec. 22, 2008
One of the few scholarly sources of data is a study which monitored the
sneezing of people undergoing an induced allergic reaction.[4]Werner E.
Bischoff, Michelle L. Wallis, Brian K. Tucker, Beth A. Reboussin, Michael A.
Pfaller, Frederick G. Hayden, and Robert J. Sherertz, "Gesundheit!"

Infect Dis. (2006) 194 (8): 1119-1126 doi:10.1086/507908 To estimate the
average sneezing rate, we can ignore all the real medical data they were trying
to gather and just look at their control group. This group was given no
allergens at all; they just sat alone in a room for a total of 176 20-minute
sessions.[5]For context, that's 490 repititions of the song Hey Jude.
The subjects in the control group sneezed four times during those 58 or so
hours,[6]Over 58 hours of research, four sneezes were the most interesting data
points. I might've taken the 490 Hey Judes. which---assuming they only sneeze
while awake---translates to about 400 sneezes per person per year.
Google Scholar turns up 5,980 articles from 2012 that mention
&quot;sneezing&quot;.[7]Google_Scholar_search_for_&quot;sneezing&quot; If half
of these articles are from the US, and each one has an average of four authors,
then if you dial the number, there's about a 1 in 10,000,000 chance that you'll
get someone who just that day published an article on sneezing.
On the other hand, about 60 people are killed by lightning in the US every
year.[8]Lightning_fatalities_by_country That means there's only a 1 in
10,000,000,000,000 chance that you'll call someone in the 30 seconds after
they've been struck and killed.

Lastly, let's suppose that, on the day this article was published, five people
who read it decide to actually try this experiment. If they call numbers all
day, there's about a 1 in 30,000 chance that at some point during the day, one
of them will get a busy signal because the person they've called is,
themselves, calling a random stranger to say &quot;God bless you.&quot;
And there's about a 1 in 10,000,000,000,000 chance that two of them will
simultaneously call each other.

At this point, probability will give up, and they'll both be struck by
lightning.
