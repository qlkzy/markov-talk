******_Falling_With_Helium_******
What if I jumped out of an airplane with a couple of tanks of helium and one
huge, un-inflated balloon? Then, while falling, I release the helium and fill
the balloon. How long of a fall would I need in order for the balloon to slow
me enough that I could land safely?

As ridiculous as it sounds, this is---sort of---possible.
Falling from great heights is dangerous.[citation_needed] A balloon could
actually help save you, although a regular helium one from a party obviously
won't do the trick.

If the balloon is large enough, you don't even need the helium. A balloon will
act as a parachute, slowing your fall to non-fatal speeds.
Avoiding a high-speed landing is, unsurprisingly, the key to survival. As one
medical paper[1]De Haven H. Mechanical_analysis_of_survival_in_falls_from
heights_of_fifty_to_one_hundred_and_fifty_feet. Injury Prevention. 6(1):62-b-
68. put it,
     It is, of course, obvious that speed, or height of fall, is not in
     itself injurious ... but a high rate of change of velocity, such as
     occurs after a 10 story fall onto concrete, is another matter.
... which is just a wordy version of the old saying, &quot;It's not the fall
that kills you, it's the sudden stop at the end.&quot;
To act as a parachute, a balloon filled with air, rather than helium, would
have to be 10 to 20 meters across---far too big to be inflated with portable
tanks. A powerful fan could be used to fill it with ambient air, but at that
point, you may as well just use a parachute.
Helium
The helium makes things easier.
It doesn't take too many helium balloons to lift a person. In 1982, Larry
Walters flew across Los Angeles in a lawn chair lifted by weather balloons,
eventually reaching several miles in altitude. After passing through LAX
airspace, he descended by shooting some of the balloons with a pellet gun.
On landing, Walters was arrested, although the authorities had some trouble
figuring out what to charge him with. At the time, an FAA safety inspector told
the New York Times, &quot;We know he broke some part of the Federal Aviation
Act, and as soon as we decide which part it is, some type of charge will be
filed.&quot;[2]ARMCHAIR_AIRMAN_SAYS_FLIGHT_FULFILLED_HIS_LIFELONG_DREAM, New
York Times, July 4, 1982
A relatively small helium balloon---certainly smaller than a parachute---will
suffice slow your fall, but it still has to be huge by party balloon standards.
The biggest consumer rental helium tanks are about 250 cubic feet, and you'd
need to empty at least 10 of them to put enough air in the balloon to support
your weight.
You'd have to do it quickly. The compressed helium cylinders are smooth and
often quite heavy, which means they have a high terminal velocity. You'll only
have a few minutes to use up all the cylinders. (As soon as you emptied one,
you could drop it.)
You can't get around this problem by moving your starting point higher. Since
the upper atmosphere is pretty thin, anything dropped from the stratosphere up
will accelerate to very high speeds until it hits the lower atmosphere, then
fall slowly the rest of the way. This is true of everything from small meteors
[3]By the time meteors hit the Earth, they have slowed_down to a few hundred
miles per hour. to Felix Baumgartner.[4]Jason Martinez, Falling_Faster_than_the
Speed_of_Sound, Wolfram Blog, October 24, 2012

But if you inflated the balloons quickly, possibly by connecting many canisters
to it at once, you'd be able to slow your fall. Just don't use too much helium,
or you'll end up floating at 16,000 feet like Larry Walters.

While researching this article,[5]Additionally, while researching impact speeds
for this article, I came across a discussion on the Straight Dope Message
Boards about survivable fall heights. One poster compared a fall from height to
being hit by a bus. Another user, a medical examiner, replied that this was a
bad comparison:

&quot;When hit by a car, the vast majority of people are not run over; they are
run under. The lower legs break, sending them into the air. They usually strike
the hood of the car, often with the back of the head impacting the windshield,
&quot;starring&quot; the windshield, possibly leaving a few hairs in the glass.
They then go over the top of the car. They are still alive, although with
broken legs, and maybe with head pain from the nonfatal windshield impact. They
die when they hit the ground. They die from head injury.&quot;

The lesson: Don't mess with medical examiners. They're apparently pretty
hardcore. I managed to lock up my copy of Mathematica several times on balloon-
related differential equations, and subsequently got my IP address banned from
Wolfram|Alpha for making too many requests. The ban-appeal form asked me to
explain what task I was performing that necessitated so many queries, so this
is what I put:

I hope they understand.
