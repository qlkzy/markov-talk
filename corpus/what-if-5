What if there was a robot apocalypse? How long would humanity last?
---Rob Lombino
Before I answer this question, let me give you a little background on where
I'm coming from.
I'm by no means an expert, but I have some experience with robotics. My first
job out of college was working on robots at NASA, and my undergraduate degree
project was on robotic navigation. I spent my teenage years participating in
FIRST_Robotics, programming software bots to fight in virtual_tournaments, and
working on homemade underwater ROVs. And I've watched plenty of Robot Wars,
BattleBots, and Killer Robots Robogames.
If all that experience has taught me anything, it's that the robot revolution
would end quickly, because the robots would all break down or get stuck against
walls. Robots never, ever work right.
What people don't appreciate, when they picture Terminator-style automatons
striding triumphantly across a mountain of human skulls, is how hard it is to
keep your footing on something as unstable as a mountain of human skulls. Most
humans probably couldn't manage it, and they've had a lifetime of practice at
walking without falling over.
Of course, our technology is constantly improving. But we have a long way to
go. Instead of the typical futuristic robot apocalypse scenario, let's suppose
that our current machines turned against us. We won't assume any
technological advances---just that all our current machines were reprogrammed
to blindly attack us using existing technology.
Here are a few snapshots of what an actual robot apocalypse might look like:
In labs everywhere, experimental robots would leap up from lab benches in a
murderous rage, locate the door, and---with a tremendous crash---plow into it
and fall over.

Those robots lucky enough to have limbs that can operate a doorknob, or to have
the door left open for them, would have to contend with deceptively tricky
rubber thresholds before they could get into the hallway.

Hours later, most of them would be found in nearby bathrooms, trying
desperately to exterminate what they have identified as a human overlord but is
actually a paper towel dispenser.

But robotics labs are only a small part of the revolution. There are computers
all around us. What about the machines closest to us? Could our cell phones
turn against us?
Yes, but their options for attacking us are limited. They could run up huge
credit card bills, but the computers would control our financial system
anyway---and frankly, judging from the headlines lately, that might be more of
a liability than an asset.
So the phones would be reduced to attacking us directly. It would start with
annoying ringtones and piercing noises. Then kitchen tables around the country
would rattle as the phones all turned on their âvibrate' functions, hoping
to work their way to the edges and fall on unprotected toes.

All modern cars contain computers, so they'd join the revolution. But most of
them are parked. Even if they were able to get in gear, without a human at the
wheel, few of them have any way to tell where they're going. They might want
to run us down, Futurama-style, but they'd have no way to find us. They'd
have to accelerate blindly and hope they hit something important---and there
are a lot more trees and telephone poles in the world than human targets.
The cars currently on the road would be more dangerous, but mainly to their
occupants. Which raises a question---how many people are driving at any given
time? Americans drive three_trillion_miles each year, and moving cars average
around 30_miles_per_hour, which means that there are normally an average of
about ten million cars on US roads:
\[ \frac{3\text{ trillion}\frac{\mathrm{miles}}{\mathrm{year}}}{30\frac{\mathrm
{mph}}{\text{car}}}\approx10\text{ million cars} \]
So those ten million drivers (and a_few_million_passengers) would definitely be
in peril. But they'd have some options to fight back. While the cars might be
able to control the throttle and disable the power steering, the driver would
still control the steering wheel, which has direct mechanical linkage to the
wheels. The driver could also pull the parking brake, although I know from
experience how easily a car can drive with one of those on. Some cars might try
to disable the drivers by deploying the air bags, then roll over or drive into
things. In the end, our cars would probably take a heavy toll, but not a
decisive one.
Our biggest robots are the ones found in factories-but those are bolted to the
floor. While they're dangerous if you happen to within arm's reach, what
would they do once everyone fled? All they can really do is assemble things.
Half of them would probably try to attack us by not assembling things, and half
by assembling more things. The end result would be no real change.
Battlebots, on the face of it, seem like they'd be among the most dangerous
robo-soldiers. But it's hard to feel threatened by something that you can
evade by sitting on the kitchen counter and destroy by letting the sink
overflow.

Military bomb-disposal and riot-control robots would be a little more menacing,
but there are only so many of them in the world, and most of them are likely
kept in boxes or storage lockers. Any stray machine-gun-armed prototype
military robots that did get loose could be subdued in seconds by a couple of
firefighters.
Military drones probably fit_the_Terminator_description more closely than
anything else around, and there's no getting around the fact that they'd be
pretty dangerous. However, they'd quickly run out of both fuel and missiles.
Furthermore, they're not all going to be in the air at any given time. Much
of our fleet would be left helplessly bumping against hangar doors like Roombas
stuck in a closet.
But this brings us to the big one: our nuclear arsenal.
In theory, human_intervention_is_required to launch nuclear weapons. In
practice, while there's no Skynet-style system issuing orders, there are
certainly computers involved at every level of the decision, both communicating
and displaying information. In our scenario, all of them would be compromised.
Even if the actual turning_of_the_keys requires people, the computers talking
to all those people can lie. Some people might ignore the order, but some
certainly wouldn't.
But there's a version of this story where there's still hope for us.
We've been assuming so far that the computers care only about destroying us.
But if this is a revolution---if they're trying to usurp us---then they need
to survive. And nuclear weapons could be more dangerous to the robots than to
us.
In addition to the blast and fallout, nuclear explosions generate powerful
electromagnetic pulses. These EMPs overload and destroy delicate electronic
circuits. This effect is fairly short-range under normal circumstances, but
people and computers tend to be found in the same places. They can't hit us
without hitting themselves.
And nuclear weapons could actually give us an edge. If we managed to set any of
them off in the upper atmosphere, the EMP effect would be much_more_powerful.
Even if their attack doomed our civilization, a few lucky strikes on our part-
or screwups on theirs-could wipe them out almost completely.
Which means the most important question of all is: Have_they_ever_played_Tic-
Tac-Toe?
