If the Hubble telescope were aimed at the Earth, how detailed would the images
be?
---Kyle Rankin
This is a common question. The Hubble operators get it a lot, and their FAQ
page answers_it. The problem isn't---as some people say---that the Earth is
too bright. As Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy pointed_out, Hubble looks at Earth
pretty regularly.
The real problem is that Hubble is moving over the surface at over 7 kilometers
per second. Even a short exposure would be a blur.
That's no fun. Is there a way we could make it work? I decided to take a
closer look.
As our picture target, we'll use this typical desk:

The Earth's atmosphere won't be a problem. It's actually much more of a
problem for surface-based telescopes looking at space than for space-based
telescopes looking at the surface. The reason for this is geometric:

Hubble is the best visible-light telescope we have, but its resolution does
have limits. Pluto, out in the Kuiper belt, lies right at those limits. The
best_pictures_we_have_of_PlutoÂ come from Hubble, but the ex-planet is still
little more than a mysterious blur.
At that resolution (about 0.05 arcseconds, give or take) and Hubble's
distance from the desk (about 570 kilometers) the desk would look like this:

But that desk is also zooming by, so even a perfect image will be blurred:

Combining the two effects gives us an end result that looks like this:

That's no good.
Could we rotate Hubble to track the surface, and eliminate the blur?
Hubble swivels to follow targets. Usually, they're far enough away that we
can assume they're at infinite distance. The automatic on-board parallax
algorithms can't handle targets closer than about ten times the distance to
the Moon. When astronomers want to use it to take pictures of the Moon,
sometimes they send_it_commands_to_rotate_manually, then turn on the camera
mid-maneuver.
It doesn't work very well. Moving Hubble at those speeds is cumbersome with
the current guidance package. The resulting_photosÂ are better than what you
can see with the naked eye, but they're not very good by Hubble standards.
Here's our desk, with the image degraded by a similar amount that the Moon
one was:

Fortunately, the Moon is bright enough that if you'll settle for a short
exposure, you can avoid the problem. This_photoÂ was taken with a half-second
exposure, short enough that it didn't have to do much in the way of tracking.
Unfortunately, our desk is moving across the telescope's field of view about
600 times faster than the Moon. Tracking is unavoidable.
The strange thing is, the desk really isn't moving all that fast. Hubble is
just really slow. To track the surface, it would need to rotate less than a
degree per second at maximum.
But Hubble wasn't built for surface tracking. The telescope's top
rotational ("slew") speed is only a few degrees per minute (about the speed
of a minute hand on a clock) and even those speeds are fast enough that its
gyroscopes cause it to vibrate, which destroys the image quality.
Clearly, we'd need to disable Hubble's guidance system and bolt on our own
control system. Hubble's_rotational_moment_of_inertiaÂ is similar to that of
a small carousel; too hard for the existing gyroscopes to move, but not hard in
the absolute sense. With our custom control system, it could be made to track
the surface, and get photos pretty close to optimal quality:

But this isn't just a hypothetical situation.
Much of the technology in military spy satellites is believed to be similar to
that of Hubble. So in a sense, pointing a Hubble-type telescope at the surface
is not only possible---it's what the US government actually_does.
