What if there's LITERALLY a tie?
---Nate Silver (Twitter,_January_4th,_2012)
In most states, a popular vote tie is broken by a coin toss or drawing names
from a hat. The odds of a many-state tie are slimmer than the odds of the hat
being hit by a bale of cocaine dumped from a drug-smuggling airplane.
Nate Silver flippantly posted his 'tie' question on Twitter during the tallying
of the extremely close 2012 Republican Iowa Caucus results. In that case, an
exact tie was averted---Santorum ended up winning by 34 votes out of 121,503.
And since it was a non-binding nominating vote, the Iowa Republican Party could
handle a tie any way they wanted.
But since it's Election Day, let's apply his question to the current
contest. What will happen if there's a tie?
I don't mean an electoral college tie. There's probably about a 1 in 500
chance of one of those this year, and the consequences are thoroughly_explored.
Instead, the question concerns both candidates getting the same number of votes
in a state.
Several researchers---including Silver_himself---have calculated the odds of a
state winner being decided by a single vote, which is effectively the same as
the probability of a tie vote. For typical close states, the linked article
calculates the probabilities to be in the neighborhood of 1 in 100,000---which
makes intuitive sense, since 100,000 is the sort of vote margin by which swing
state elections are typically decided.
So what if there's a tie in a close state this year?

For that matter, what if there's a tie in every battleground state?

Well, for starters, recounts happen. But since recounts happen in close
elections in general, these are just as likely to create ties as to break them.
They don't change the underlying probability. So let's assume that after
all recounts, there's a tie. What then?
The short answer is that it's up to the state's laws.
I went through the general laws of nine competitive states to see how they
handle popular vote ties. In most of them, the tie is broken by "drawing
lots"---that is, randomly. (If you're curious, here are links to some tie
vote laws in each state: Virginia, North_Carolina, Florida, Ohio, New
Hampshire, Wisconsin, Colorado, Iowa, Nevada).

"Drawing lots" can mean a coin toss, drawing straws, or picking a name from
a hat. Most states leave the details up to the Secretary of State or an
electoral board, although Iowa Code 50.44 specifies that the names be written
on pieces of paper and placed in a "receptacle". In North Carolina,
however, a tie vote (when more than 5,000 votes are cast) results in a new
election. (Which could potentially itself result in a tie ...)
But let's imagine that there's not just one state that's tied---instead,
the nineÂ most competitive states are tied (and the rest go as expected). If
North Carolina held a runoff to break the tie, and the other eight states
flipped coins (or picked from Iowa's receptacle), Obama would be reelected in
431_out_of_512_cases---about 84% of the time.
But how likely is a nine-state tie?
If we ballpark the odds of a tie vote in each close state at 1 in 100,000, then
the odds of a tie vote in all nine states is in the neighborhood of one in a
quattuordecillion---1 followed by 45 zeroes. (This ignores vote correlation
between states, but it's good enough for a first-order estimate).
Florida is hit by an average of 66_tornadoes_per_year. If each tornado is 50
yards wide and has a path 1.5 miles long (which is typical, if not necessarily
the mean), we can calculate that a typical location in Florida experiences an
average 1.4 picotornados per second:
\[66\tfrac{\text{tornadoes}}{\text{year}}\times\frac{1.5\text
{ miles}\times50\text{ yards}}{\text{Area of Florida}}\approx1.4\times10^{-
12}\tfrac{\text{tornadoes}}{\text{second}}\]
Astronomer Alan Harris calculates that a person's lifetime odds of death from
a comet or meteorite impact are about 1 in 700,000. If a typical person in the
calculation lives 70 years, this suggests a Florida resident suffers an average
of 0.64 femtodeaths per second from meteorite impacts:
\[\frac{\tfrac{1}{700,000}\text{deaths}}{70\text{ years}}\approx6.4\times10^{-
16}\tfrac{\text{deaths}}{\text{second}}\]
In 1994, drug smugglers fleeing the authorities dropped an estimated 20 bales
of cocaine from an airplane over Florida---one of which crashed_through_the
roof_of_a_Crime_Watch_meeting_and_narrowly_missed_the_Homestead_Chief_of
Police. If Florida has been hit by 20 bales of cocaine over the last 20 years,
then the average person in Florida is struck by an average of 29 zeptobales of
cocaine per second:
\[\frac{20\text{ bales}}{20\text{ years}}\times\frac{\left (\tfrac{75\text
{ kg}}{\text{Density of cocaine}} Â \right )^\tfrac{2}{3}}{\text{Area of
Florida}}\approx2.9\times10^{-21}\tfrac{\text{bales}}{\text{second}}\]

(By the way---this means that given a street price of $20,000 per kilogram, a
typical acre of Florida land produces an average revenue of three cents per
year in falling cocaine bales).
Putting all this together: The probability that every battleground state is
exactly tied is roughly equal to the probability that, when one of the Florida
electors reaches into the hat to draw a name, he or she is struck by a falling
cocaine bale, the hat is hurled away within the next few seconds by a tornado,
and the elector is obliterated minutes later by a meteorite impact.

If you're in the US, don't forget to vote---your vote could make or break a
tie.
And if you're voting in Florida, keep an eye on the sky.
