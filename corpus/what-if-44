How high can a human throw something?
---Irish Dave on the Isle of Man
Humans are good at throwing things. In fact, we're great at it; no other
animal can throw stuff like we can.
It's true that chimpanzees hurl feces (and, on rare occasions, stones), but
they're not nearly as accurate or precise as humans. [1] [2] AntlionsÂ throw
sand, but they don't aim it. ArcherfishÂ hunt insects by throwing water
droplets, but they use specialized mouths instead of arms. Horned
lizardsÂ shoot jets of blood from their eyes for distances of up to five feet.
I don't know why they do this because whenever I reach the phrase "shoot
jets of blood from their eyes" in an article I just stop there and stare at
it until I need to lie down.

So while there are other animals that use projectiles, we're just about the
only animal that can grab a random object and reliably nail a target. In fact,
we're so good at it that some researchers have suggested rock-throwing played
a central role in the evolution of the modern human brain.[3][4]
Throwing is hard. In order to deliver a baseball to a batter, a pitcher has to
release the ball at exactly the right point in the throw. A timing error of
half aÂ millisecond in either direction is enough to cause the ball to miss the
strike zone.[5]
To put that in perspective, it takes about fiveÂ milliseconds for the fastest
nerve impulse to travel the length of the arm.[6] That means that when your arm
is still rotating toward the correct position, the signal to release the ball
is already at your wrist. In terms of timing, this is like a drummer dropping a
drumstick from the 10th story and hitting a drum on the ground on the correct
beat.

We seem to be much better at throwing things forward than throwing them
upward.Â Since we're going for maximum height, we could use projectiles that
curve upward when you throw them forward; the Aerobie_OrbitersÂ I had when I
was a kid often got stuck in the highest treetops. But we could also sidestep
the whole problem by using a device like this one:

It could be a springboard, a greased chute, or even a dangling sling---anything
that redirects the object upward without adding to---or subtracting from---its
speed. Of course, we could also try this:

But the deflector box seems easier.
I ran through the basic aerodynamic calculations for a baseball thrown at
various speeds. I will give these in units of giraffes:

The average person can probably throw a baseball at least three giraffes high:

Someone with a reasonably good arm could manage five:

A pitcher with an 80 mph fastball could manage ten giraffes:

Aroldis Chapman, the holder of the world record for fastest recorded pitch (105
mph), could in theory launch a baseball 14 giraffes high:

But what about projectiles other than a baseball? Obviously, with the aid of
tools like slings, crossbows, or the curved xisteraÂ scoops in jai alai, we can
launch projectiles much faster than that. But for this question, let's assume
we stick to bare-handed throwing.
A baseball is probably not the ideal projectile, but it's hard to find speed
data on other kinds of thrown objects. Fortunately, a British javelin thrower
named Roald Bradstock held a random_object_throwing_competition, in which he
threw everything from dead fish to an actual kitchen sink. Bradstock's
experience gives us a lot of useful data (and a lot of other data, too). In
particular, it suggests a potentially superior projectile: A golf ball.
Few professional athletes have been recorded throwing golf balls. Fortunately,
Bradstock has, and he claimsÂ a record throw (to first contact with the ground)
of 170 yards.[7] This involved a running start, but even so, it's reason to
think that a golf ball might work better than a baseball. It makes sense; the
limiting factor in baseball pitches is the torque on the elbow, and the lighter
golf ball might allow the pitching arm to move slightly faster.
The speed improvement from using a golf ball instead of a baseball would
probably not be very large, but it seems plausible that a professional pitcher
with some time to practice could throw a golf ball faster than a baseball.
If so, based on aerodynamic calculations, Aroldis Chapman could probably throw
a golf ball about sixteen giraffes high:

This is probably about the maximum possible altitude for a thrown object.
... unless you count the technique by which any five-year-old can beat all
these records easily:
